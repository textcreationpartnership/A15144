            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And to the end, that the wiſe men of the world may be more wiſe to ſaluation; that ignorant ſoules may bee inlightned with the knowledge of the truth; that the naturall man may be borne againe, may awake from the dead ſleepe of his ſinnes, and liue the life of grace; that worldly minded men may bee leſſe earthly, and more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly minded; that prophane people may be more religious; that wicked and vngodly men may come to repentance; that hypocrites may bee more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſincere; and that the godly may be more confirmed in the good way, and more encouraged to hold on the good courſe which they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, that continuing to the end, they may bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; I haue penned this Treatiſe; <hi>Declaring how a ſinner may bee ſaued, and come to life euerlaſting.</hi> Which, if it may finde fauour in your Honours eyes, it will be more welcome to the world, I ſhall be more encouraged in the worke of the Lord; and be for e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>thou beleeueſt that there is one God, thou doeſt well; the Deuils alſo beleeue and tremble.</hi> That is, the Deuils haue a generall knowledge of the Word of God, and the things contained therein, and beleeue that whatſoeuer is written in the Word of God, is true; they beleeue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, that God is a iuſt God, and will puniſh ſinners; yea, they know and beleeue, that God hath prepared Hell for the tormenting, not onely of wicked and vngodly men, but for the euerlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of the Deuill and his Angels; this they beleeue, and beleeuing, tremble: but they want the true faith to apprehend the mercy of God in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one ſaith of the faith of Deuils, that it is <note n="ſ" place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, ſome haue had power giuen them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, <note place="margin">3 Miraculous faith.</note> to doe wonders, and worke miracles, and that by the gift of <hi>Faith:</hi> which faith was a ſpeciall gift of God, either to doe ſome ſtrange and extraordinary worke, <note place="margin">Parae.</note> which could not be done by ordinary meanes; or elſe, a gift of fore-telling things to come, by diuine reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

It is held that <hi>Iudas</hi> wrought miracles, as did alſo the reſt <note place="margin">

Of this faith, and the nature of it, more is to be ſpoken in the next place, where I come to ſhew what the true faith is.</p>

In regard of men ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, faith is diuerſe: but inaſmuch as the <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>obiect</hi> of faith is, as one ſaith, the <hi>firſt truth,</hi> becauſe faith is conuerſant about the Truth, and that there is but one <hi>Truth,</hi> from hence it is, that there is but <hi>one true faith,</hi> by which wee can be ſaued.

               <p>Secondly, in true faith, there is required an aſſent vnto <note place="margin">2 An aſſent vnto the Word of God.</note> the Word of God; that is, to euery word of God in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: and in particular, to the promiſes of the Goſpell, made to them that beleeue: becauſe it is ſayd; <note n="h" place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, in true ſaith, there is required a perſwaſion <note place="margin">3 A perſwaſion of the mercy of God.</note> of the mercy of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the remiſſion of ſins, and euerlaſting ſaluation, through the merits of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with a particular application of the ſame; whereby the true beleeuer is perſwaded, that the promiſes of God made in the Goſpell, to them that beleeue; doe aſwell belong vnto him, as vnto others; and aſſuredly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that through the merits of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he himſelfe ſhall

               <p>Laſtly, let the Atheiſt knocke at the doore of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> owne conſcience, and aske what that meaneth, that at the hearing of thunder-claps, at the flaſhing of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and at the mighty moouing of the earth, hee is ſo afrayd and trembleth.

               <p>The third ſort of Atheiſts, are they, who deny God <note place="margin">3 By their deeds.</note> by their deedes; of which denying of God, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes to <hi>Titus,</hi>

                  <hi>They profeſſe that they know God, but in workes they deny him, being abominable and diſobedient, and vnto euery good worke reprobate.</hi> Heere is mention of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying God; but who deny him? they that profeſſe they know God. How may that bee, that they which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe God, ſhould alſo deny God? they profeſſe him in words, but deny him in deedes. Such Atheiſts as theſe, there were in the Apoſtles time, I would there were not cauſe to complaine of ſuch in our time. Many, yea, the moſt men profeſſe that they know God; they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there is a God, and they acknowledge that God is to be worſhipped; yet many deny God by their workes. Conſider this firſt in prophane people: Demand of the greateſt Swearer, Prophaner of the Saboth, Quarreller, Adulterer, Drunkard, &amp;c. whether he know God. Hee will profeſſe that he knowes God: but look to his deeds, and you ſhall finde that they are vile and abominable: his workes are ſuch, and his manner of life ſuch, as if he rather thought in his heart there were no God: neither
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21095:43"/> God nor Deuill, neither Heauen nor Hell. Secondly, conſider this in Hypocrites; they profeſſe that they know God, they worſhip God publikely, and it may be priuately too; in the Church, and in the houſe; they read the Scriptures, heare the Word, and receiue the Sacraments: in a word, they will not be behinde in any outward religious duty of piety and holineſſe. And all this is godly and religious. What then is wanting? one thing is wanting; the practice of godlineſſe: a good life, a godly conuerſation anſwerable to their profeſſion: this is wanting. For conſider, in regard of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the duties of piety; how ſome doe all in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew, and for vaine-glory: pray and faſt, to be ſeen of men: and giue almes, to haue praiſe of men: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their workes of righteouſneſſe, their dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, how farre they are from doing vnto others, as they would that men ſhould do vnto them: further, let it be obſerued, how diuerſe will take their times and opportunities, when they are out of the company of the godly, they be for all companies; to doe as others doe: to ſweare among Swearers, to game with Gameſters, to drinke with Drunkards, to bee partakers with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, and as the ſaying is, among Good-fellowes to play the Good-fellow; to carowſe and drinke healths, &amp;c. and by theſe things it may euidently appeare, that though they profeſſe they know God, yet by their works they deny him. Theſe are no good Chriſtians, no ſound Profeſſours; becauſe their words and their workes doe not agree together: their conuerſation is not anſwerable to their profeſſion: but theſe are Hypocrites, yea, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts; denying God: <hi>They profeſſe that they know God, but in workes they deny him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, ſeeing that wicked life, and a bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation rankes a man, either amongſt the prophane, or amongſt Hypocrites, and ſuch as deny God: my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to all that know God aright, and to thoſe that make a good profeſſion, is, that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to

               <p>God, who hath appointed the end, hath alſo ordained meanes to the end: the end is the ſaluation of our ſoules: that's the end of our Faith, that's the bleſſed end that we deſire, and long for; now the meanes of obtaining ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, is to come to the knowledge of the truth: to know and acknowledge the onely true God, and <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> whom hee hath ſent. So neceſſary is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</p>
               <p>For the Second; how profitable the knowledge of <note place="margin">2 The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is profitable. For</note> God is, appeareth by the benefits that come thereby. Which are ſpecially theſe two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the true knowledge of God worketh peace and concord amongſt men of contrary diſpoſitions; and <note place="margin">1 It maketh peace amongſt men of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſpoſitions.</note> correcteth the froward natures of men; making them, of fierce and wrathfull, to become gentle and patient. This was fore-ſhewed by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſaying. <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>The Wolfe ſhall dwell with the Lambe, the Leopard ſhall lie downe with the Kid: and the Calfe, and the young Lyon, and the Fatling together, and a little childe ſhall lead them. And the Cow and the Beare ſhall feed, &amp;c. They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountaine: for the earth ſhall bee full of the knowledge of the LORD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where the knowledge of God is, it will work a great alteration and change: if by nature men be like Wolues, giuen to deuoure and deſtroy their neighbours; the the knowledge of God will cauſe them to ceaſe from their rauinous, greedy deuouring of others: if they bee
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21095:48"/> by nature like Lyons and Beares, fierce, wrathfull, blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-minded; the true knowledge of God will tame them, and make them meeke and gentle.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if any now in the time of the Goſpell, be like Wolues, and Lyons, and Beares, towards their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and neighbours; it is, becauſe they haue not the true knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>But heere it will be ſayd, that ſome that haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> are wrathfull, cruell, and hard-hearted towards their brethren.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; their knowledge is not ſanctified: they haue <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> knowledge, but not grace to put their knowledge in practice: they know God, but will not doe the will of God. They haue the knowledge of God in their heads, but not in their hearts. For certaine it is, if men had the true knowledge of God, aſwell in their hearts and mindes, as in their heads and tongues; they would not, they durſt not be to their brethren, as Wolues, and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Beares; the knowledge of the Lord would make them more peaceable, more quiet, and patient.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the true knowledge of God brings eternall <note place="margin">2 Eternall life commeth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</note> life: ſo ſaith our Sauiour, <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>This is life eternall, to know thee the onely true God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing concerning the knowledge of God, is, the hurt and danger that comes through the want <note place="margin">3 The want of the knowledge of God, is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: for it cauſeth,</note> thereof. As the knowledge of God is neceſſary and profitable, ſo the want therof is hurtfull and dangerous.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the want of the knowledge of God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth mourning and languiſhing, deſolation and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: as the Lord ſheweth in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> complaining that there was <note n="p" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, where the knowledge of God is not, men are giuen ouer to a reprobate minde, to doe things that <note place="margin">2 A reprobte minde.</note> are not conuenient. This <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſheweth, ſpeaking of the <hi>Gentils,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to them that know not God, there remaines <note place="margin">3 Puniſhment.</note> nothing but iudgement, puniſhment, and euerlaſting deſtruction; as ſaith the Apoſtle, <note n="ſ" place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord Ieſus ſhall be reuealed from Heauen, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpell of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with euerlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth thing concerning the knowledge of God, <note place="margin">4 Meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may come to the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God.</note> is the meanes whereby wee may come to the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</p>
               <p>That there is a God, may be knowen (as hath beene already ſhewed) by the light of Nature, and by the book of the Creatures: and that there is one true God, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the Scriptures: the Word of God reuealeth the Vnity of the God-head, and the Trinity of Perſons; but to the attaining to the right knowledge of the one only true God, by a particular knowledge, to know him to be God vnto vs, to acknowledge the one onely true God, to bee <hi>our Lord,</hi> and <hi>our God,</hi> (as hath beene formely more fully declared) there is required more then the light of Nature. more then the booke of the Creatures: and more then bare knowledge of the Scriptures: for this particular knowledge of God, is attained vnto, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Two.</note> by the Word of God, and partly by the Spirit of God: the one being an outward, the other an inward <note place="margin">1 By the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> meanes, to teach vs the true knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>The true knowledge of God, then is attained vnto,</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that wee carefully and attentiuely heare <note place="margin">2 Hearing the Word of God.</note> the word of God preached. Eor <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>I haue giuen vnto them the words which thou gaueſt mee, and they haue receiued them, and haue knowne ſurely, that I came out from thee, and they haue beleeued that thou didſt ſend me.</hi> In which words, he ſheweth three things; firſt, he gaue them his Word: ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>condly, they receiued it: and thirdly, by the Word of God, they knew God, and <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> whom hee had ſent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that wee ſeriouſly meditate vpon the Word <note place="margin">3 Meditating vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Word.</note> of God, which we haue read, or heard: <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <note n="a" place="margin">

Thus the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of God is attained unto by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the true knowledge of God is attained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <note place="margin">2 By the Spirit of God.</note> through the gracious working of the Spirit of God in our hearts; for God muſt firſt put it into our hearts, to know him, before wee can know him.

               </p>
               <p>This of the particular knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>Now the conſideration of the great neceſſity of the <label type="milestone">

               <p>Firſt, thoſe who content themſelues with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">1 Againſt thoſe that content themſelues with a generall knowledge of God.</note> knowledge of God; that there is a God, that there is one God, that God made all things, that God is to bee worſhipped, &amp;c. but are not carefull to come to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular knowledge of God: to know God to be their God, and ſo to know God, as to beleeue in him, to feare him, and to loue him, to truſt in him, and to depend vpon him. But if we would be ſaued, and come to euerlaſting life, we muſt labour to attaine to a particular knowledge of God; for the bare generall knowledge of God will not ſaue vs; for euen wicked men, Reprobates, yea, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, <note place="margin">2 Againſt the Romiſts, who will not ſuffer the people to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</note> haue a generall knowledge of God; they know that there is a God, yea, they know there is one God, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth S. <hi>Iames,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing that the meanes of attaining to the true knowledge of God, is (as hath beene ſhewed) by the Scriptures, by reading, and hearing the Word of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21095:50"/> God, and meditating thereon; this reproues the Romiſh Church, which will not ſuffer the Lay-people to haue the Scriptures in a knowne tongue, nor to read them in a language which they vnderſtand, but locke vp the Scriptures from them in a ſtrange language; and ſo will not ſuffer the ſimple people to come to the knowledge of the truth; contrary to the word of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing that the knowledge of God, is (as hath <note place="margin">3 Againſt thoſe who wilfully liue in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> beene ſhewed) ſo neceſſary, ſo profitable, and the want thereof ſo hurtfull and dangerous; and that there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo meanes to come to the knowledge of God: this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooues thoſe, who, notwithſtanding theſe things, yet ſtill liue in ignorance, and doe not labour to come to the knowledge of the truth, that they may bee ſaued: though the light ſhine, they walke ſtill in darkneſſe, and though meanes of ſaluation be offered, yet they refuſe, or at leaſt, neglect the meanes; inaſmuch as they doe not diligently read the Scripture, nor attentiuely heare the word of God preached, neither by meditation pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in their hearts; inaſmuch as they doe not ſuffer it to take rooting in their hearts, but ſuffer it to ſlip out of their mindes, and doe not pray vnto God for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vpon their hearing and reading of the Word of God. For certainely, there is no man (hauing reaſon and capacity to vnderſtand) but vſing theſe good means, might attaine to the knowledge of God. If a man that is as yet ignorant of the true knowledge of God, would diligently apply himſelfe to the reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to the hearing of the Word read and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when he hath heard the Word of God, if he would lay it vp in his heart, and meditate thereon; and laſtly, if he would earneſtly pray vnto God, for the obtaining of the Spirit of God, to inlighten his vnderſtanding with true ſauing knowledge, and that God, by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

               <p>The corporall, and externall knowledge of Chriſt, was, the viſible ſeeing and knowing of Chriſt, when he <note place="margin">1 Externall and viſible know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt.</note> was vpon the earth, when he went about doing good, and preaching the <hi>Goſpell</hi> of the kingdome.

               <p>The generall knowledge of Chriſt, is, to acknowledge <note place="margin">1 Generall.</note> that the ſecond perſon in Trinitie, is the Sonne of God, and that the Sonne of God, became the ſonne of man; to acknowledge according to the Scriptures, that the <note n="d" place="margin">

               <p>Now for the neceſſitie thereof. <note place="margin">2 The neceſſitie of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Ieſus Chriſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The knowledge of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is ſo neceſſarie, that</p>
               <p>Firſt, whoſoeuer wants the true knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt, he is ignorant, and knowes nothing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for his ſoule, although, he haue the knowledge of all arts and tongues; and whoſoeuer hath the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">1 He that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ignorant.</note> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> is happie and bleſſed; he knowes ſufficient to make him euerlaſtingly bleſſed, though he be vnskilfull in Languages, and haue but ſmall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in humane learning.</p>
               <p>When the Rulers of the people, and the Elders, had called before them <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Apoſtles of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:21095:52"/> and <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaw the boldneſſe of Peter and Iohn, and perceiued that they were vnlearned and ignorant men, they marueiled, and they tooke knowledge of them that they had beene with Ieſus. Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were not brought vp in learning; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had beene with <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and had knowne <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> they had better knowledge, and more true lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then all the Scribes and Doctours of the Iewes; ſo that they were able to reaſon and diſpute with them, and ouercome them, through the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>I determined not to know any thing among you, ſaue Ieſus Chriſt, and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi> Certainly <hi>Paul</hi> was learned; for he was <note n="o" place="margin">

                  <hi>was not a whit behind the chiefeſt Apoſtles: neither was he rude in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> Yet notwithſtanding, when he comes to preach the Goſpell, he doth not ſeeke his own prayſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, by affected eloquence, and oſtentation of humane learning, but ſo preacheth Chriſt Ieſus, as though he knew no other learning, but Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In regard of the excellent knowledge of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <note place="margin">2 In regard here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all things elſe are baſe and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</note> Chriſt, all things elſe whatſoeuer, are to be eſteemed baſe and contemptible.

                  <hi>What things were gaine to me, thoſe I counted loſſe for Chriſt. Yea doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and I count all things but loſſe, for the excellencie of the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord; for whom I haue ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the loſſe of all things, and doe count <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, without the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt, we <note place="margin">3 Without it we cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> cannot be ſaued. Our Sauiour ſaith, <note n="r" place="margin">

                  <hi>my ſheepe heare my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I giue vnto them eternall life, and they ſhall neuer periſh.</hi> So that the elect of God, the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, which are marked &amp; knowne for the true ſheepe of Chriſt, doe know Chriſt, they know his voice, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21095:53"/> heare his voyce, and obey his Word, yea, they ſo know him, as to follow him. And to them that ſo know <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> he giueth life eternall, and they ſhall neuer periſh.</p>

               <p>The errours concerning the offices of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are in the Romiſh Church: true it is; the Romiſts, in words, confeſſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> to bee a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet; yet, in deede and in truth, by their doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, they deny his offices: for confirmation heereof: <note place="margin">Of</note>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, concerning the Propheticall office of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as he is a Prophet, hee is the Inſtructor and Teacher of <note place="margin">3 A Prophet.</note> his Church, by his Spirit, and written Word: for his Word is his will; and his Word ought to be our Rule, in matters both of faith and godly life: but the Church of Rome, beſides the Scriptures, and Word of God, brings in a heape of humane Traditions, which their Doctors and Teachers, will haue to be receiued as <note n="x" place="margin">Traditiones ſimpliciter neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſariae ſunt.

                  <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply neceſſary:</hi> holding that all things needefull to faith, and a Chriſtian life, are not contained in the Scriptures, but that wee muſt ſeeke many things from Traditions: whereas we hold, that whatſoeuer is neceſſary to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to faith, and a godly life, is contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, euen in the written Word of God, either expreſly, or ſo, as may rightly be collected and gathered from the Scriptures.

                  <note n="y" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>All Scripture is giuen by inſpiration of God, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable for doctrine, for reproofe, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſnes, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed vnto all good workes.</hi> Wherefore, if we will hold the truth, concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Offices, wee muſt hold, and acknowledge him to be a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet to his Church, and that not in word onely, but alſo in deede and in Truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is denied by Apoſtaſie: when <note place="margin">3 By Apoſtaſie. Two-fold.</note> men fall away from the truth, which they haue knowne and profeſſed. And this is two-fold:</p>
               <p>Particular, and</p>
               <p>Vniuerſall.</p>
               <p>The particular back-ſliding, and falling away, is two-fold. <note place="margin">1 Particular fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away. Two-fold.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>one</hi> is, when a Chriſtian, hauing turned from his former euill courſe of life, and framed himſelfe to liue a <note place="margin">1 By falling into ſome great and grieuous ſin.</note> godly life, and now making a profeſſion of religion, doth fall into ſome great and grieuous ſinne, whereby
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21095:55"/> he doth not onely ſinne againſt God, but doth alſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the people of God, and giues occaſion to others to ſpeake euill of the way of the Lord. An example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is in <hi>Dauid</hi> committing adulterie with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> to whom the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> rebuking him, ſaith not onely thus, <note n="z" place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art the man:</hi> thou art he that haſt done this wickedneſſe, and haſt ſinned againſt God; but he ſaith alſo, <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>by this deed, thou haſt giuen great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme.</hi> This is an euill falling away, but yet this fall is recouerable; for <hi>Dauid</hi> ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly repented, and was receiued to fauour: <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Dauid ſaid vnto Nathan, I haue ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Nathan ſaid vnto Dauid, the Lord hath alſo put away thy ſinne, thou ſhalt not die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other kind of particular back ſliding, and falling <note place="margin">2 By falling from the profeſſion of Chriſt, and that two waies</note> away, is a falling away from the profeſſion of Chriſt: and that either through</p>
               <p>Infirmitie, or</p>
               <p>Securitie.</p>
               <p>Firſt, through Infirmitie; ſo <hi>Peter,</hi> who had made a <note place="margin">1 Through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</note> profeſſion of Chriſt, &amp; had alſo boaſted what he would doe, and ſuffer for Chriſt, <note n="c" place="margin">

                  <hi>denied Chriſt</hi> three times.</p>
               <p>Secondly, through Securitie: falling away from a <note place="margin">2 Through ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> mans former zeale, and ſinceritie of his profeſſion: an example hereof, we haue in the Angell of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to whom Chriſt ſaith, <note n="e" place="margin">

                  <hi>I haue ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt loue.</hi> But both theſe fals are recouerable; for of <hi>Peter</hi> it is ſaid, <hi rend="sup">f</hi> 
                  <hi>he went out, and</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 75.</note>

               </p>
               <p>This of the particular Apoſtaſie, and falling away:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21095:56"/> which is onely a backſliding, and falling away in part, and that for a time.</p>
               <p>There is alſo an vniuerſall falling away: and that is <note place="margin">2 Vniuerſall fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away. Two-fold.</note> alſo two-fold.</p>
               <p>The firſt, is an vniuerſall falling away form a mans former righteouſneſſe, from his holineſſe of life, and godly conuerſation: when any one fals from vertue, to <note place="margin">1 From a mans former righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and holineſſe, to prophaneneſſe and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> vice: and from a godly conuerſation, to profaneneſſe, and notorious wickedneſſe; this is a kinde of denying Chriſt: yea, this is, of the ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſeruant of the Deuill: euen as a ſeruant which r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, ſhewing the dangerous ſtate of thoſe that ſo fall away: <note n="h" place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. 21. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>If after they haue eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, they are againe intangled therein, and ouer come, the latter end is worſe with them then the beginning. For it had beene better for them not to haue knowne the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, then after they haue knowne it, to turne from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commaundement deliuered vnto them.

               <p>The ſecond vniuerſall falling away, is, when a man, <note place="margin">2 By ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt. What it is to ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt</note> hauing beene inlighted by the holy Ghoſt, with the knowledge of God, and his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made a profeſſion of Chriſt, doth afterwards, deny the truth, againſt his owne knowledge, and conſcience, doth maliciouſly oppoſe himſelfe againſt the knowne
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21095:56"/> truth, and euen perſecute thoſe that profeſſe the truth.</p>
               <p>This is properly called the ſinne againſt the holy <note place="margin">Sinne againſt the holy Ghoſt why ſo called.</note> Ghoſt: not, becauſe ſinne can be ſo committed againſt the holy Ghoſt, but it is alſo againſt the Father, and the Sonne: and when the holy Ghoſt is offended, the Father is offended, and the Sonne is offended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Godhead is one. But it is called the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, becauſe this ſinne is committed againſt the proper and immedrate working of the holy Ghoſt: which is, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the minds and vnderſtandings of men, with the true knowledge of God, and his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. Now, when the holy Ghoſt hath inlightned any one, with the true knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt, and afterwards he ſo fall away from the truth, that he deny Ieſus Chriſt, and malicouſly perſecute the knowne truth; this, is to ſinne againſt God, and againſt Ieſus Chriſt, but properly and after a ſpeciall manner, it is, to ſinne againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt: inaſmuch as he ſinneth againſt the immediate inlightning of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Of this ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, with the fearfull ſtate of thoſe which fall into this ſinne, the Scripture e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently ſpeakes: the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſaith, <note n="i" place="margin">

               </list>
               <p>The ſecond thing, is the puniſhment which vſually <note place="margin">2 The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them that ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt.</note> befals thoſe that ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt: and that's three-fold.</p>
               <p>The firſt, is finall impenitencie: they that ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, are ſtricken with a marueilous hardnes of heart, ſo that they cannot repent, they are paſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: <note place="margin">1 Finall impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie.</note> wherefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <hi>he that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the holy Ghoſt, hath neuer forgiueneſſe.</hi> This ſecond puniſhment followeth vpon the firſt: one is the cauſe of the other; they that ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſhall neuer haue forgiueneſſe, becauſe they haue not grace to repent: true it is; the mercie of God is great, aboue all our tranſgreſſions, and God denieth mercie to no ſinner that doth truly repent: and therefore, if a ſinner, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, or whatſoeuer he be, haue grace to repent him truly of his ſinnes, to beleeue the remiſſion of his ſinnes, and to call and cry to God for mercy, he may haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: but he that ſinneth againſt the holy Ghoſt, his heart is ſo hardned that he cannot repent, but dies without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and therefore cuts himſelfe off from mercie, and forgiueneſſe; and ſo is the cauſe of his own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The third, is a miſerable, and fearfull end. They that <note place="margin">3 A fearfull end.</note> ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, vſually die a fearfull and ſhamefull death. We haue two memorable examples hereof: the one is of <hi>Iudas Iſcariot,</hi> one of the twelue: who was inlightned with the knowledge of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> he was the Diſciple of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he preached <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and wrought myracles in the name of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fell away, and that fearefully: for he betrayed Chriſt for money; but what was his end?

                  <hi>how ſhall they call on him, in whom they haue not beleeued?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, they haue faith, which doe ſhew forth the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and fruits of faith in their life, by their carefulnes <note place="margin">4 They that ſhew their faith by their workes.</note> to pleaſe God, to walke in obedience to his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to be exerciſed in good workes.

               </p>
               <p>So then it appeares, that although all men haue not, yet ſome haue the true faith: though Reprobates, and the enemies of the Goſpell, and prophane people, and Hypocrites, haue not faith; yet many there are, that haue faith.

               <p>The conſideration of this, that all men haue not faith, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> ſerues firſt for inſtruction; to teach vs, if in the courſe of <note place="margin">Maruell not that vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men are ſo wicked.</note> our life, we meet with vnreaſonable and wicked men, and wonder at it, that men ſhould be ſo diſordered, goe ſo out of ſquare, be ſo notoriouſly wicked, and ſo vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to deale with; that we ceaſe to maruell. For, <hi>All men haue not faith.</hi> They are naturall men, they doe but their kinde: they haue not faith: for, if they had faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, they would not be ſo vile, ſo wicked and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in their doings, but they would be more orderly, more reaſonable to deale with, yea, they would bee of better life, and of more ſober conuerſation. Let vs not then maruell, but rather pray, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> praies the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians to pray for him, that wee may bee deliuered

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the conſideration of this, that though all <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> men haue not, yet many haue true ſauing faith; ſerues <note place="margin">Conſolation to them that haue true faith.</note> for conſolation. Its a good euidence to a man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the aſſurance of his ſaluation, if hee be aſſured that hee hath true faith. For all men haue not faith; faith is not common to all, but proper and peculiar to the Elect.</p>
               <p>Now then, when as a Chriſtian, vpon good and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can aſſure himſelfe that hee hath true faith; he may then alſo ſafely gather aſſurance, that he is of the number of Gods Elect, and therefore ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely be ſaued: for the Elect, and only the Elect, haue faith, and as many as are ordained to ſaluation, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. From hence, the true beleeuer, through true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith, aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, gathers the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his owne ſaluation: and receiues comfort to his ſoule, that he is one of Gods Elect, and ſhall bee ſaued. With this heauenly meditation, the ſorrowfull ſoule of a ſinner is refreſhed with this ſweet conſolation, he goes away in peace, lies downe in peace, and reſts in peace.</p>

But on the other ſide, whoſoeuer is conuerted and turned to God, whoſoeuer is crucified to the world, dead to ſinne, and hath true, ſauing faith, beleeuing in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> to ſaluation; ſuch a one, is quickned by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he is now raiſed from the death of ſin to the life of righteouſneſſe, and now, he is no more dead, but aliue: he liues by the faith of the Sonne of God, ſo that faith is the verie true life of the ſoule, as it were the ſoule of the ſoule: for as the ſoule giues life to the bodie, ſo Faith giues life to the ſoule: and as the bodie without the ſoule is dead, ſo the ſoule without faith is dead alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, without faith, nothing that we doe, can <note place="margin">2 Without faith nothing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God.</note> pleaſe God. Wherefore it is, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe him.</hi> Whether therefore we faſt, or pray, or giue almes, whatſoeuer ſpirituall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice we offer vnto God, or whatſoeuer good thing we doe, if we would haue the Lord to accept our ſacrifice and ſeruice, and to be wel pleaſed with our good workes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21095:61"/> we muſt looke that we haue faith; that our prayers, and thankeſgiuings, almſdeeds, and whatſoeuer good thing we doe, proceede from a heart purified by Faith. Faith is as neceſſarie in our ſpirituall ſacrifices, &amp; good works, that they may pleaſe God; as ſalt was in the ſacriffces in the Leuiticall law; Where it was commaunded, that <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>euery oblation of their meat offering, they ſhould ſeaſon with ſalt:</hi> as ſalt ſeaſoned their ſacrifices, ſo faith ſeaſoneth our ſacrifices: and therefore as our Sauiour ſaith to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 50.</note> 
                  <hi>haue ſalt in your ſelues:</hi> ſo I ſay to all, <hi>haue faith in your ſelues.</hi> For through Faith, our workes are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, and pleaſe God; but without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, without faith, we cannot be ſaued. True <note place="margin">3 Without faith we cannot be ſaued.</note> faith is ſo neceſſary, that if a man haue the true faith, he is ſaued, he cannot periſh: but if he want the true faith, he is damned, he cannot be ſaued. The Scripture wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth the truth of this. Our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>he that beleeueth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaued, but he that beleeueth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Againe, he ſaith, <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>he that beleeueth on him, is not condemned: but he that beleeueth not is condemned alreadie, becauſe he hath not beleeued in the Name of the onely begotten Sonne of God.</hi> So great is the neceſſitie of true, ſauing Faith.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of this great neceſſitie of Faith, is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> profitable for inſtruction; it teacheth vs, to be carefull, <note place="margin">To get faith into our hearts</note> by all meanes to get faith into our hearts. If we would haue any true aſſurance, that we are not ſtill dead in ſin, but are quickned by the Spirit, and liue in Chriſt: if we would haue our workes, our ſeruice, and ſacrifices to be acceptable to God; or if we would eſcape condemnation and come to life euerlaſting; then its neceſſarie that we labour to haue true, ſauing Faith: for without faith, (as I haue proued) we are but dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, and haue no true life of grace in vs: without faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we doe can pleaſe God: and without faith we cannot be ſaued. Seeing then that faith is ſo neceſſarie,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21095:61"/> how doth it ſtand euery one in hand, to labour for true, ſauing faith? The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith, <note n="i" place="margin">

                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Knowing</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that a man is not iuſtified by the workes of the Law, but by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, euen wee haue beleeued in Ieſus Chriſt, that wee might bee iuſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the workes of the Law.</hi> The third and fourth chapters of the Epiſtle to the Romans, ſtand vpon this argument, affirming that we are iuſtified <hi>by Faith, without the workes of the Law:</hi> and proouing in the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>righteouſneſſe is imputed vnto vs by Faith.</hi>

                  <hi>For if Abraham were iuſtified by workes,</hi> as ſaith <hi>S. Paul, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. For what ſaith the Scripture? Abraham beleeued God, and it was counted vnto him for righteouſneſſe.</hi>

               <p>I anſwer, firſt, there is a twofold Iuſtification; the one <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Rom</hi> 4. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham beleeued God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> There is alſo a Iuſtification before men, and this, is <hi>by workes</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from faith; and ſo we are iuſtified <note n="h" place="margin">Declaratiuè.</note> 
                  <hi>declaratiuely,</hi> that is, our workes, proceeding from faith, doe declare before men, that wee haue faith: our good workes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth of our faith, and manifeſt that our faith is not in vaine.

               </p>

               <p>Secondly, concerning the affaires of this preſent life; for Faith doth teach and direct a man in the courſe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his life, what to doe, and how to liue. As firſt, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a mans vocation and calling, faith teacheth a man to walke diligently in his vocation, and calling, and to depend vpon God, for a bleſſing vpon his labours.</p>
               <p>Secondly, faith teacheth a man to commit his wayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to the Lord, and to referre the ſucceſſe of his affaires and buſineſſe to God: and to waite vpon God, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his things to paſſe.</p>

                  </label> faith, is the Word of God; this ſerues to reproue thoſe, <note place="margin">Againſt thoſe that boaſt of their faith, and yet contemne, and lightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes of obtaining faith.</note> who deſpiſe and contemne, or greatly neglect the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word, and yet boaſt that they haue faith. Diuerſe there are, that ſeldome come to the houſe of God, and very ſeldome heare Sermons; who, if they be queſtioned, whether they haue faith, will not ſticke to anſwer euery one for himſelfe; yea, I haue faith, and doe beleeue; I haue a good faith to God, I hope to bee ſaued aſwell as the beſt, and hope to come to Heauen, as ſoone as they that follow Sermons. But I demand of thee, ô vaine man; if thou haſt ſo good a faith, and ſo good hope of ſaluation, how, and by what meanes, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt thou by this thy good faith? The Scriptures tels vs plainely, that the meanes of obtaining faith, is, by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Word of God. And ſeeing thou doeſt not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the houſe of God, nor heare the Word of God preached (except it be at ſome times, and by ſtarts) how can it be that thou haſt true faith? or, if thou haſt it, how was it wrought in thee? and by what meanes haſt thou obtained it? it is the great blindneſſe of many ignorant ſoules, to thinke they haue faith, when they haue it not. And they haue it not, becauſe they doe not vſe the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

I know, and deny not; God is not tyed to any meanes; and therefore can extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily worke faith in the hearts of men, euen in whom be will, according to his good pleaſure: but it is not ſafe for any one, to venture the ſaluation of his ſoule vpon the extraordinary working of God, when as God in great wiſdome, and mercy to mankinde, hath appoynted or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means to beget faith, and to worke our ſaluation; which ordinary meanes, is the hearing of the Word: for <hi>faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The meanes whereby Faith is nouriſhed, increaſed, and preſerued, are three.</p>
               <p>The Word,</p>

               <p>Prayer. <note place="margin">1 The Word of God. And that by.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the firſt: The word of God is a meanes to increaſe faith: and that diuerſe waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by reading the word: the diligent reading of the Scriptures, is neceſſarie for them that doe beleeue, to <note place="margin">1 Reading the Scriptures.</note> the increaſing and preſeruing of their faith. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> who had receiued the faith, and did now beleeue, giues them commandment, concerning the reading of his Epiſtle, and chargeth that others
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21095:68"/> ſhould read it alſo. for he ſaith, <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>When this epiſtle is</hi> read <hi>amongſt you, cauſe that it be</hi> read <hi>alſo in the Church of the Laodiceans, and that ye likewiſe</hi> read <hi>the Epiſtle from Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea.</hi> and <hi>S.

                  <hi>giue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to</hi> reading, <hi>to exhortation, to doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by hearing the word of God: for, as the <note place="margin">2 Hearing the word of God.</note> hearing of the word of God, is an effectuall meanes to beget faith, ſo is it alſo a powerfull meanes to nouriſh, ſtrengthen, and preſerue faith. It is a rule in nature, <note n="c" place="margin">Ex ijſdem nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimur ex quibus ſumus.</note> 
                  <hi>we are nouriſhed by the ſame things, of which we are begotten:</hi> Now ſpiritually, we are begotten by the word of God, as ſaith <hi>S. Iames,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>of his owne will be gate he vs, with the word of truth,</hi> and therefore we are ſpiritually nouriſhed by the word of God. For this cauſe, the word of God is ſaid to be the meate of the ſoule: it is both milke for young babes, and ſtrong meate for ſtrong men. They that are but young children in religion, babes in grace, may ſuck milke out of Gods word, to nouriſh their ſoules, &amp; they that are ſtrong in faith, and growen in grace, may from the word of God, receiue ſtrong meat to ſtrengthen them more. Of which the Apoſtle ſpeakes to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>euery one that vſeth</hi> Milke <hi>is vnskilfull in the word of righteouſneſſe; for he is a</hi> babe <hi>but</hi> ſtrong meat <hi>belongeth to them that are of full age. S. Peter</hi> giueth this exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note n="f" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore laying aſide all malice, and all guile, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and enuies, and euill ſpeakings, as new borne babes deſire the ſincere milke of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> as a new borne babe deſires the mothers breaſts, and by ſucking wholſome milke out of her breaſts, is nouriſhed, and growes thereby; ſo a Chriſtian, though he be but newly begotten by the word of truth, be but a young chriſtian, a beginner, and be but as yet a weake chriſtian; yet if he diligently heare the word of God, and if his ſoule doe earneſtly deſire to ſucke the ſincere, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome milke of the word; this is a powerfull meanes to nouriſh his ſoule, to ſtrengthen his faith, and make him grow in grace.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:21095:68"/>
               <p> Thirdly, by deuine meditation. It is noted to be a property of a godly man, to meditate on the word of <note place="margin">Diuine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> God. <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>His delight is in the law of the Lord,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</hi> the word of God is compared to meate: which, to the end that it may giue nouriſhment to the body, its neceſſarie, that it not onely enter into the mouth, and be chewed with the teeth, but that it go downe into the ſtomacke and be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted: ſo likewiſe, to the end that the word of God may giue true, and ſubſtantiall nouriſhment to our ſoules, its neceſſary, not only that we heare the word with our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eares, but ſuffer it to enter into our heart, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly digeſt it by meditation. It was one propertie of cleane beaſts mentioned in the leuiticall law, to <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 11. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>chew the cud:</hi> and he is ſuch a cleane creature, who hauing heard the word of God, and committed it to his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, doth afterward meditate vpon the ſame, &amp; ponder it in his mind; to the end, that his faith may be increaſed that he may be nouriſhed in the truth, &amp; grow in grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by Godly conference: the two diſciples, to <note place="margin">4 Godly confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> appeared after his reſurrection, and talked with them, ſaid one to another, <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>did not our heart burne within vs, while he talked with vs by the way, and while he opened to vs the Scriptures?</hi> the ſpirituall communication, and heauenly conference which <hi>Chriſt</hi> had with the Diſciples, did heate them inwardly, and made their hearts burne within them: godly conference, ſpirituall ſpeech, and heauenly communication doth inflame the heart, with the loue of God, doth ſtirre vp the affections, and kindle good deſires: yea, increaſeth knowledge, and ſtrengthneth faith: thus the Word of God, which begetteth faith, doth alſo increaſe, nouriſh, and preſerue the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meanes of increaſing faith, is the vſe, and <note place="margin">2 Vſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> partaking of the Sacraments. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Word and Sacraments, are as the two breſts of the Church; whereout, the faithfull ſoule ſuckes ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <note place="margin">1 Nouriſhing the ſoule.</note>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:21095:69"/> nouriſhment, ſtrength of faith, and increaſe of grace. Baptiſme giues a Chriſtian admiſſion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Church of God, whereby he is ingraffed into the myſticall body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and made a member of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and by the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the members of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are nouriſhed to eternall life. Of which nouriſhment, receiued ſpiritually by faith, it is, that our Sauiour ſaith, <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 53, 54.</note> 
                  <hi>Except yee eat the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloud, yee haue no life in you. Who ſo eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, hath eternall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Sacraments are a meanes of increaſing <note place="margin">2 Confirming the promiſes of the Goſpell.</note> and ſtrengthening our faith; for they confirme the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made vnto vs in the Goſpell; for which cauſe, they are called Seales; for like as a man, making a grant to another in writing, of houſe, or lands; for the better confirmation and ſtrenthening of the deede, he puts to his ſeale; ſo the Lord our God, to his gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull promiſes, made vnto vs in his written Word, hath annexed the Sacraments, as ſeales, to aſſure vs of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his promiſes. God made great and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes vnto <hi>Abraham;</hi> that hee would make of him <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>a great nation,</hi> that hee would <hi>bleſſe him,</hi> and in him, ſhould <hi>all families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> That hee would <note n="m" place="margin">

                  <hi>to be a God vnto him, and to his ſeede after him.</hi> And to the end that <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith might be confirmed and ſtrengthned in the promiſes of God, hee gaue him the Sacrament of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>a token of the Couenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and him:</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls a ſeale, <note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>And hee receiued the ſigne of circumciſion, a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of the faith, which he had yet being vncircumciſed.</hi> So alſo in the new Teſtament, the Lord hath made a moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and mercifull promiſe, that <note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoeuer beleeueth in the Sonne of God, ſhall not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> And God, to ratifie and confirme this his couenant, hath ſealed it with the bloud of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:21095:69"/> 
                  <hi>bloud of the new Teſtament, which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> This is the Couenant of Grace: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, we for our parts, are bound to beleeue in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> and God, for his part, promiſeth remiſſion of ſinnes, and euerlaſting life, vpon condition that wee beleeue. And for confirmation of this his promiſe, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> hath ſealed the Couenant with his own bloud: by which ſeale of the Couenant, our faith is confirmed, and ſtrengthned in the aſſurance of the promiſes of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The third meane, is Prayer: <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſaith, <note n="ſ" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Euery</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3 Prayer.</note> 
                  <hi>good gift, and euery perfect gift is from aboue, and commeth downe from the Father of lights.</hi> Now, faith is the gift of God, and God doth not onely giue grace, but likewiſe increaſe of grace, according to that ſaying of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Vnto euery one that hath, ſhall be giuen, and hee ſhall haue abundance.</hi> Now the meanes to bring downe from the Father of lights, both the gifts of grace, and increaſe of grace, is Prayer; and therefore the meanes of increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the gift of faith, is Prayer. From hence it is, that <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Marc.</hi> 9 24.</note> 
                  <hi>the father of the childe cryed out, and ſayd with teares, Lord I beleeue, help thou mine vnbeleefe.</hi>

                  <hi>And the Apoſtles ſaid vnto the Lord, Increaſe our Faith.</hi> Thus Faith is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, increaſed, and preſerued, by the threefold meanes of the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that faith is nouriſhed and ſtrengthned, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>

Fire, to the end it may burne, muſt neceſſarily haue wood, or other fuell mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto it; or elſe, by little and little, the heat ſlacketh, and in the end, the fire goeth out. Our life is maintained

               <p>God who hath giuen to a man a body, hath alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and prouided meanes, to nouriſh and ſuſtaine the body: ſo likewiſe, the Lord God, who hath giuen vnto man a ſoule, hath appoynted him meanes to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and ſtrengthen his ſoule. Wherefore, if wee would haue our faith (which is the life of the ſoule) nouriſhed, increaſed, and preſerued; wee muſt make conſcience of reading the Scriptures diligently, hearing the Word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently, meditating vpon it ſeriouſly, conferring about it willingly, receiuing the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per frequently, and praying vnto the Lord earneſtly, for the increaſe of faith: elſe, as ſure as the fire, without fuell, goeth out, and the body, without nouriſhment, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth away; ſo, without the vſe of theſe holy meanes, the ſeeming graces of the Spirit will ſoone bee extinguiſhed, the ſoule will pine away, and periſh.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21095:72"/> wicked men of the world, nor all the Deuils in hell, are able to breake aſunder any one of the linkes of this chaine which is in Gods hands. And therefore they that are within the compaſſe of this chaine, are ſure to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to be receiued vp into glory.

               <p>Some may here demand, How may I be aſſured, that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> it is the good Spirit of God, which certifies me, that I am the child of God, and haue faith; or that it is not a fancie, or bare coniecture of mine owne, or that it is not ſome deluſion? How ſhall I be able to diſcerne betweene <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> theſe? I anſwere; the Spirit of God, the true witneſſe, doth certifie our ſpirit, and aſſure our conſcience, that we haue indeed true, iuſtifying faith, that we are the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted ſonnes of God, and ſhall certainly be ſaued, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Spirit of God perſwades our conſcience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that we haue faith, vpon good ground, and ſound reaſon, taken, not from our owne works, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, but from the goodneſſe and bountifulneſſe of God towards vs, from the mercie of God, and grace in Chriſt: and ſo, neither the fleſh, nor the Deuill doth perſwade.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Spirit of God perſwades vs of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of faith, by the effects which it worketh in vs. As namely, the purifying of the heart, purging out ſinne; ſo that no ſinne hath rule and dominion in the heart; likewiſe, ſtirring vp in our hearts, a loue of God, a hatred of ſinne, an earneſt deſire to pray vnto God, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to pleaſe God; alſo an inward ſpirituall ioy, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21095:75"/> peace of conſcience, &amp;c. All which, are true effects, and manifeſt fruits of the Spirit, and cannot come eyther from the fleſh or the Deuill, and therefore the teſtimony of the Spirit, is a true, and ſure witneſſe, to aſſure vs, that we haue the true faith: and he that beleeueth on the ſon of God, hath this <hi>witneſſe in himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond, is an inward feeling of ſpirituall grace, <note place="margin">2 A feeling of grace.</note> a feeling of faith in a mans ſelfe. When a man is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the truth of the Goſpell, and all the promiſes contained therein; and in particular, is perſwaded for himſelfe, that his ſinnes, of the mercie of God, and through the merites of Chriſt, are pardoned, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into fauour with God: the inward feeling, and perceiuing of this in the <note n="b" place="margin">Menti noſirae, fides noſtra con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicua, eſt.</note> 
                  <hi>heart,</hi> is a ſigne of faith. This was in <hi>Dauid,</hi> after that he had confeſſed his ſinnes vnto God, as he witneſſeth, ſaying, <note n="c" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The third, is a godly deſire, and a holy, reſolued pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to walke in obedience to Gods commandements; <note place="margin">3 A godly deſire and purpoſe to obey Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> to pleaſe God, and to doe his will. This was alſo in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> for he ſaith, <note n="d" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The fourth, is deuout prayer, calling vpon the name of the Lord, with confidence, that God will heare our prayers, and grant our requeſts. For faith if it be in the <note place="margin">4 Deuout prayer</note> heart indeed, will ſet the heart a-working, to thinke on God, to pray vnto God, and to call vpon his name.

                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10.</note>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21095:75"/> ſeeke vnto the Lord, and call vnto him for grace and mercy. This is the ſame Spirit, which <note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>For we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought; but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for vs, with gronings which cannot bee vttered.</hi> This is alſo that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath to the Galatians, <note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe yee are ſonnes, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Sonne into your hearts, crying, Abba Father.</hi> By all which, it is manifeſt, that it is a ſure and certaine ſigne of true faith, if the Spirit of God worke this grace in vs, to ſtirre vp our hearts, by deuout prayer and ſupplication, to ſeeke vnto God, to runne vnto our Heauenly Father, and to cry <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> A childe in time of ſickneſſe, paine, and griefe, or being in any perill and danger, whither doth he run, or to whom doth he cry, but to his father? he hopes his father will helpe him, and therefore calls and cryes to his father, complaines and makes his mone to his father. Like as the <hi>Shunamites</hi> ſonne, when he was ſore grieued with a paine in his head, came to his father and ſayd, <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>My head, my head.</hi> So, the ſonnes and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, in time of their heauineſſe of ſoule, when they are ſicke with ſinne, diſeaſed in ſoule, and troubled in conſcience, with the burthen of their ſinnes, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee in any outward affliction or trouble, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they run, but to their Heauenly Father? and as the <hi>Shunamites</hi> childe ſayd to his father, <hi>My head, my head;</hi> ſo they euery one cry, <hi>My ſoule, my ſoule; My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, my conſcience:</hi> my ſoule is in heauineſſe, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſore troubled and burdened, with the heauy waight of my ſinnes. And then in hope of the mercy of God in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> they humbly confeſſe their ſinnes, they hide not their iniquities, they earneſtly craue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſue for the pardon of their ſinnes; aboue all things, they ſeeke eaſe to their afflicted ſoule, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to their diſtreſſed conſcience: building vpon thoſe gracious word of our Sauiour <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Come vnto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will giue you reſt.</hi> And
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21095:76"/> thus to call vpon the name of the Lord, is a ſigne of ſaith.</p>
               <p>The fiſt, is an inward conflict betweene the Fleſh and <note place="margin">5 Conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fleſh and the ſpirit. Two-fold.</note> the Spirit: and that is two-fold.</p>
               <l>The one, is a ſtriuing againſt ſinne.</l>
               <l>The other, a ſtriuing againſt doubtings.</l>
               <p>Touching the firſt: no man in this life is perfectly <note place="margin">1 A ſtruing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne.</note> ſanctified; but hath neede to pray more and more for the Spirit of ſanctification, that he may bee wholly ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. Hence it is, that though a naturall, and vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man bee wholly carnall, yet a regenerate man is not all ſpirituall; but partly carnall, and partly ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. For although a Chriſtian, regenerate, and ſanctified, hath his heart purified by faith; yet naturall corruption is not altogether purged out of the heart: that remaines in vs <note n="k" place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>to exerciſe vs.</hi> This, in the children of God now regenerate and ſanctified, is called <hi>fleſh:</hi> and the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied part in them, is called <hi>ſpirit.</hi> And in the regenerate, there is a great combat, a ſpirituall fight, and great ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing betweene theſe two, the <hi>fleſh</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> which ſhall get the victory. The manner of which combat and inward fight, <hi>S. Paul</hi> deſcribes thus: <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>The fleſh lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth againſt the ſpirit, the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other: ſo that ye cannot doe the things that ye would.</hi> A Chriſtian regenerate and ſanctified, is in the way to Heauen, and the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that is, the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied part drawes him on to God-ward, and haſtens him forward towards the Kingdome of Heauen: but the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that <hi>is,</hi> the corruption of nature, rebels and labours to draw him backwards to the world; and would, if it were poſſible, draw him downe to hell. Hence it is, that a Chriſtian findes in himſelfe, pride of heart, luſt of the fleſh, filthy deſires, vncleane thoughts, couetous deſires, anger, hatred, enuy, malice, grudgings, and deſire of reuenge, &amp;c. haling and pulling him one way; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe, he feeles humility, temperance, loue, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, meekneſſe, and other graces, drawing him another
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21095:76"/> way. Now, if a man doe finde grace ſtriuing againſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, good motions of the good Spirit, fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt bad motions of the euill Spirit, and if a man doe indeede and in truth, finde that he doth earneſtly ſtriue againſt ſinne, that he labours to mortifie his affections, to crucifie the fleſh with the affections and luſts, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due ſinne and wickedneſſe, this is a ſigne of grace, and a ſure marke that faith is in the heart, at leaſt, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. According to that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24.</note> 
                  <hi>They that are Chriſts, haue crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.</hi> As <note n="n" place="margin">

                  <hi>Rebecca</hi> knew her ſelfe to bee quicke with childe, by the ſtruggling and ſtriuing of the twins in her wombe; ſo a Chriſtian may know whether he be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by grace, and liue by faith in the Sonne of God, by the inward conflict and ſtriuing betweene the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond kinde of inward conflict betweene the <note place="margin">2 A ſtriuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note> fleſh and the ſpirit, is an inward ſtriuing againſt doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and diſtruſts in Gods mercy. It is the Deuils po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, either to cauſe men; whiles they remaine in their naturall ſtate, without true faith and repentance, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume on Gods mercy; or elſe hauing faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to ſet before them their ſinnes, and to ſuggeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts, doubtings of the remiſſion of their ſins, doubtings concerning their faith and repentance, and doubtings concerning their vocation, and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

But againſt all theſe difficulties, true iuſtifying faith, if it be in the heart, will ſhew it ſelfe, though perhaps in theſe temptations, but weakely, yet truely, to ſtriue againſt temptations, and to fight againſt all theſe doubtings. It is true, I confeſſe; the children of God may be troubled with doubtings, but not ouercome of doubtings. <hi>Dauid</hi> is driuen to this expoſtulation, <note n="o" place="margin">

They may, for a time, haue diſtruſtfull thoughts, and doubtfull ſpeeches, but faith in the end gets the vpper hand.

Wherefore, to finde in our ſelues a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſuch diſtruſtfull doubtings, is a ſigne of Faith: as appeareth in that ſaying of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>

                  <hi>Examine your ſelues whether yee be in the faith, prooue your owne ſelues: know ye not your owne ſelues, how that Ieſus Chriſt is in you, except you be reprobates?</hi> Now then let vs euery one make a ſearch into our hearts, and try whether wee finde the good Spirit of God perſwading vs indeede, that wee are the children of God, and that wee haue faith: whether we haue a feeling of ſpirituall grace: whether the Spirit of God hath wrought in vs a loue of God, a hatred of ſinne, a reſolued purpoſe to amend our liues: whether we finde in our ſelues, the ſpirit of grace and of ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and whether we can truely finde that inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit. If theſe things be in vs, happy are we. But if vpon examination had, theſe things be wanting in any, ſuch men may ſpeake of faith, but as yet they haue it not: they are farre ſhort of true
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21095:77"/> ſauing faith, and ſo come ſhort of ſaluation. Let the ſearch be made a little more inwardly: A man may know whether hee hath faith, by the inward feeling of grace; if faith be in the heart, the Spirit of God will ſet it a working, it will not lie aſleep, but it will ſtirre vp other graces of God in vs; it will make vs to loue God, and hate ſinne, more then euer we did before. It will moue vs to pray, and call vpon the name of the Lord. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if any one doe not feele in himſelfe, a gracious working of the good Spirit, if he finde not in himſelfe a farre greater loue of God, and loathing of ſinne, if hee haue not a more holy purpoſe to obey God, &amp; to do his will; if he doe not, nor cannot pray, if in his trouble and affliction, outward and inward, hee doe not ſeeke vnto God, if he doe not with the childe, run to his Heauenly Father, and cry, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> it's an euident ſigne, that as yet, <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not dwell in his heart by faith, &amp; that as yet he liues not by the faith of the Sonne of God. Let vs ſearch yet a little further; the vnregenerate man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in ſinne, liues in the manifeſt tranſgreſſion of the Commandements of God, yet preſumes hee hath faith. I hope, ſaith hee, I haue a good faith: but how is it, ô man, if thou haſt true faith, that thou ſtill liueſt in ſinne? certaine it is, if faith were in thy heart, it would cauſe a reformation of life, or at leaſt, a holy purpoſe of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life. And ſo in time, and by degrees, thy heart would be renewed, and thy life reformed.</p>
               <p>Indeede, I know I ought to reforme my wayes, and amend my life, and I would faine amend, but it is the fleſh that drawes mee to euill. But I demand of thee, ô man that complaineſt of the fleſh, where is the inward conflict betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit? and where is thy ſtriuing againſt thy corruptions? what, doe euill thoughts ariſe in thy heart, and thou makeſt no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? doth thy heart ſwell with pride? doe filthy luſts ariſe in thy heart? doth thy heart abound with couetous deſire? and ouerflow with the gall of bitterneſſe, anger,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21095:78"/> hatred, enuy, malice, and deſire of reuenge? and doeſt thou not ſtriue againſt theſe corruptions, but giueſt way vnto them, entertaining them, and embracing them? certainely, heere is no good ſigne of grace, nor of true faith. For where true faith is, there will be a reſiſting of ſinne, and a ſtriuing againſt corruptions. Wherefore, if we would haue a good teſtimony in our ſelues, of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of true faith, then wee muſt bee carefull to reſiſt ſinne, and to ſtriue againſt our corruptions: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the combate will be great, to maſter our ſinnes, and to get dominion ouer our corruptions, yet by little and little, we ſhall ouercome, and in the end, get the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.

               </p>
               <p>Of patience in ſuffering, I will entreate,</p>
               <p>Firſt, generally, of ſuffering all manner of afflictions, inward and outward, as they come from God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, particularly, of ſuffering iniuries &amp; wrongs from men.</p>
               <p>Firſt, of ſuffering afflictions in generall: and therein <note place="margin">1 In ſuffering af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. And therein, two things.</note> I will ſhew,</p>
               <p>Firſt, wherein the ſufferings of a Chriſtian conſiſt, and what things are required thereunto, that his ſufferings may be acceptable, and well pleaſing vnto God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I will vſe motiues to perſwade vnto patient ſuffering.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: That the ſufferings of a Chriſtian may <note place="margin">1 How our ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings may pleaſe God. Three things required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</note> pleaſe God, three things are required thereunto.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The firſt, is, to ſuffer for the name of Chriſt:</item>
                  <item>The ſecond, is, to ſuffer for any righteous cauſe,</item>
                  <item>The third, is, to ſuffer patiently.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Touching the firſt: Euery ſuffering is not commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable before men, much leſſe acceptable before God: but that ſuffering is commendable, and acceptable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, which is</p>
               <p>Firſt, for <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ſake, and the Goſpels ſake. When a <note place="margin">1 To ſuffer for. the name of Chriſt.</note> Chriſtian ſuffers tribulation &amp; perſecution for the name of Chriſt. Of this, our Sauiour ſaith, <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>bleſſed are ye, when men ſhall reuile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of euill againſt you, falſlie for my ſake.</hi> To which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth the ſaying of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>if ye be reproched for the name of Chriſt, happie are ye:</hi> this was the honour and glorie of thoſe Chriſtians, who haue beene perſecuted, tormented, and ſuffered death for Chriſts ſake. For they rather yeelded to ſuffer death, then to denie Chriſt. This is the Crowne of Martyrdome, for it was not their bare
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21095:79"/>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Non paena, ſed cauſa verum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Martyrem. Cypr.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuffering that made them Martyrs, but their cauſe.</hi> Becauſe they ſuffered for the name of Chriſt. Wherefore, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, though they ſuffer neuer ſo manie, and ſore tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet they are not Martyrs, neither are their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings acceptable to God: becauſe they ſuffer not for Chriſt's ſake: nor for the truth, but againſt the truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſufferings are acceptable to God, when they <note place="margin">2 To ſuffer for well-doing.</note> are for well-doing: and when we are afflicted, perfecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and troubled wrongfully. As <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſaith, <note n="g" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>This is thanke-worthy, if a man for conſcience toward God endure griefe, ſuffering wrongfully.</hi> Againe, he ſaith, <note n="h" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>it is better if the will of God be ſo, that ye ſuffer for well-doing, then for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill doing.</hi> And againe, <note n="i" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 15. 16</note> 
                  <hi>let none of you ſuffer as a murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or as a theefe, or as an euill doer, or as a buſibodie in other mens matters, yet if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing, which makes our ſufferings accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, is to ſuffer patiently. Whether it be for <note place="margin">3 To ſuffer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently.</note> Chriſt's ſake, or whether it be in any other righteous cauſe, it is the part of a Chriſtian, not onely to ſuffer, but to ſuffer patiently. For this is the difference betweene the wicked and the godly, concerning their ſufferings: both may ſuffer afflictions, as ſickneſſe, infirmitie, and paine of bodie, pouertie, and ſuch like, but not both alike: both may ſuffer the ſame things, but not with the ſame mind. The wicked ſuffer afflictions of neceſſitie, becauſe they cannot helpe themſelues, and know not how to be ridd of their paine, and troubles; their ſuffering is a conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuffering, and their patience, patience perforce. But the godly ſuffer afflictions patiently: they endure all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which the Lord layes vpon them, with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde, a meeke heart, and quiet patience. Such ought our ſufferings to be, that they may pleaſe God.</p>

                  <hi>Chriſt alſo ſuffered for vs, leauing vs an example, that ye ſhould follow his ſteps, who did no ſinne, neither was guile found in his mouth.

               <p>Theſe are examples written for our inſtruction, to teach vs patience: Wherunto we may adde the worthy examples of the ſeruants of the Lord, thoſe faithfull ones, mentione by the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> who through faith endured great trials, ſome were <note n="u" place="margin">

               <p>The ſecond motiue, to perſwade vs to patience in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <note place="margin">2 The neceſſitie of afflictions.</note> afflictions, I take from the neceſſity of afflictions.</p>

               <p> Afflictions are very neceſſarie for Chriſtians, and <note place="margin">For afflictions are</note> therefore are to be endured with patience: for</p>

               <p>The Third motiue, to perſwade vs to ſuffer afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons patiently, I take from the benefit of afflictions. what <note place="margin">3 The benefit of afflictions.

               <p>HItherto of Patience in ſuffering afflictions in <note place="margin">2 In ſuffering wrongs and iniuries from men. And therein two things.</note> generall. There is alſo Patience to be ſhewed, in ſuffering wrongs and iniuries from men. In handling whereof, I will ſhew,</p>
               <p>Firſt, what the wrongs and iniuries are, which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may, or can ſuffer from men: that ſo hee may ſee how farre his patience is to extend, and ſtretch it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I will make it manifeſt, that a Chriſtian is to ſuffer wrongs and iniuries from men.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: All wrongs and iniuries that one man <note place="margin">1 The ſorts and kindes of wrongs and iniuries. Three-fold.</note> may or can doe to another, may bee reduced to theſe three heads.</p>
               <p>They are either touching,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, a mans body, and ſo concerne his perſon: or</item>
                  <item>Secondly, a mans goods: or,</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, a mans good name.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And theſe wrongs and iniuries to others, are, or may <note place="margin">Which may be done two wayes.</note> be done, two waies: either</p>
               <p>Secretly, or</p>
               <p>Openly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Secretly, by the euill imaginations &amp; thoughts <note place="margin">1 Secretly.</note> of the heart. When an enuious or malicious minded man thinkes euill of his neighbour in his heart: concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which, the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> hath this admonition: <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Let none of you imagine euill in your hearts, againſt his neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, more openly and manifeſtly: and that <note place="margin">2 Openly.</note> both by</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:21095:84"/>
               <p> Word, and <note place="margin">Two manner of wayes.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Deed.</p>
               <p>For, both by word and deede, a man may do wrong to his neighbour, three wayes; In regard of</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, his body,</item>
                  <item>Secondly, his goods.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, his good name.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, a man may doe wrong to his neighbours bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: <note place="margin">1 To a mans body. And that,</note> and that,</p>
               <p>Firſt, by word; diſcommending and diſgracing his perſon, or ſpeaking diſdainefully and ſcornefully, of the ſhape and proportion of his body. <note place="margin">1 By word.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by deede; as ſmiting his neighbour, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and wounding his body, or ſhedding his bloud: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <note place="margin">2 By deede.</note> by abuſing the body of any, through fornication, or any manner of vncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wrongs and iniuries may bee done to a <note place="margin">2 To a mans goods. And that,</note> man, concerning his goods:</p>
               <p>Firſt, by word; when any one ſpeaks the worſt of his neighbours goods, diſpraiſing his corne, or cattell, or wares, or any thing that his neighbour hath; with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <note place="margin">1 By word.</note> to bring others in diſlike with his neighbours goods, and ſo to hinder him in the ſale of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by deede; when any one offers any perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">2 By deede.</note> wrong to a mans children, or ſeruants, by ſmiting and hurting them: or when any one doth ſteale and purloyne any mans goods, or violently take them from him: when any one goeth about to hurt and hinder an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of his right, and when one doth treſpaſſe againſt his neighbour, and either ſpoile or hurt his neighbours corne or cattell, or any thing that is his.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, men may doe wrong to others, in regard of <note place="margin">3 To a mans good name. And that,</note> their good name. And that,</p>
               <p>Firſt, by word; by railing termes, reuiling ſpeeches, and falſe accuſations; by ſlandring, and back-biting; <note place="margin">1 By word.</note> and by any manner of words, which may tend to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming and diſcrediting of a mans neighbour.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:21095:85"/>
               <p> Secondly, by deede; by the act of bearing falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">2 By deede.</note> before a Magiſtrate: for there, not only the tongue ſpeakes, but the hand acts a part, and both tongue and hand agree together, to teſtifie an vntruth againſt his neighbour.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſorts and kindes of wrongs, which any man may or can doe vnto another. Now, in the ſecond <note place="margin">2 To ſuffer wrong pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.</note> place, I am to prooue, that it is the part of a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, when he is iniuried and wronged; to ſuffer wrong and iniury, and that patiently; whether the wrong bee touching his body, goods, or good name. Which I <note place="margin">Motiues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</note> manifeſt,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, by teſtimonies of Scripture.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, by example in Scripture.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt. The Scripture is plentifull in precepts <note place="margin">1 Teſtimonies of Scripture.</note> and exhortations to patience, in ſuffering wrongs. Our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>Loue your enemies, bleſſe them that curſe you, doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully vſe you, and perſecute you.</hi> Heere is great patience required; for if any one haue an enemy that railes on him, and reuiles him, that ſpeakes euill againſt him, yea, curſeth him, he is commanded to bleſſe: if our enemy hate vs, we are to wiſh well vnto him, yea, to doe him good; and if our enemy ſhould trouble vs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute vs, and deſpitefully vſe vs, yet wee are to pray for our enemy, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> prayed for his Crucifiers, <note n="c" place="margin">

                  <hi>Father, forgiue them.</hi> And as <hi>Steuen</hi> prayed for his Perſecutors, <note n="d" place="margin">

                  <hi>Why doe yee not rather take wrong? why doe yee not rather ſuffer your ſelues to be defrauded?</hi> adde heereunto, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the Romanes, <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in you, liue peaceably with all men.</hi> It is hard for a man to liue peaceably with all men; yet it is not impoſſible; and therefore the Apoſtle would haue euery one to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by all meanes, as much as lies in him, to preſerue peace and concord with all men, which a man cannot
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21095:85"/> poſſibly doe, except hee bee content to ſuffer much, and to put vp many wrongs and iniuries, whether they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his body, goods, or good name.</p>
               <p>And to perſwade vs yet more to patient ſuffering of <note place="margin">2 Examples of ſuffering wrong.</note> wrongs, wee are not deſtitute of examples of rare pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſuffering wrongs, and putting vp iniuries, both in body, goods, and good name.</p>
               <p>Of patient ſuffering wrongs and iniuries in body, <note place="margin">1 In body.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> is our example; who to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſaith, that he was in <note n="g" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11 23, 24, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtripes aboue meaſure, in priſon more frequent: in deaths <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>approoue himſelfe as the Miniſter of God, in much patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of patience in ſuffering wrongs in goods, <hi>Iob</hi> is an <note place="margin">2 In goods.</note> example; who was robbed of his Oxen and Aſſes, by the <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Sabeans:</hi> and of his Camels, by the <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Caldeans:</hi> theſe <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Caldeans</hi> made out their bands, and came with force againſt <hi>Iobs</hi> ſeruants, they cruelly ſlue his ſeruants, and violently tooke away his goods and ſubſtance, his Oxen, his Aſſes, and his Camels: all which wrongs and iniuries from the hands of cruell men, <hi>Iob</hi> tooke patiently, and ſayd, <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <hi>The Lord gaue, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, for patient ſuffering of wrongs and iniuries, <note place="margin">3 In good name.</note> concerning a mans good name, <hi>Dauid</hi> is our example: for he ſaith, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 12, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>They that ſit in the gate, ſpeake againſt mee; &amp; I was the ſong of the Drunkards. But as for me, my prayer is vnto thee, ô Lord. Dauid</hi> confeſſeth, that wicked men, ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> prophane people, very Drunkards, as they ſate ouer their pots, did abuſe him in words, ſpake euill of him behinde his backe, and made ſongs of him. And yet ſuch was <hi>Dauids</hi> patience, that he ſuffered theſe things, he endured all, and gaue himſelfe to prayer. But <hi>Dauids</hi> patience is moſt apparent, in forbearing the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21095:86"/> words of <hi>Shimei;</hi> who in <hi>Dauids</hi> hearing, railed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, ſaying, <note n="m" place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Come out, come out, thou bloudy man, &amp; thou man of Belial:</hi> and when <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> one of <hi>Dauids</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, would haue gone out in all haſte, and ſtricken off the head of <hi>Shimei,</hi> for railing on the King, and curſing him, <hi>Dauids</hi> anſwer was, <note n="n" place="margin">

                  </label> wrongs: whether a Chriſtian be ſo bound to ſuffer all manner of wrongs and iniuries from men, as that he is to ſit downe with all wrongs, and to put vp all iniuries whatſoeuer: or whether a Chriſtian may not in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſeeke by lawfull meanes, to right himſelfe of his wrongs?</p>
               <p>For anſwere hereunto; we are to conſider, that wrongs <label type="milestone">

               <p>And of wrongs, there are three degrees. <note place="margin">Three degrees of wrongs.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, ſome, are ſmall offences, little wrongs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries: as diſgracefull, and diſdainfull ſpeeches, which <note place="margin">1 Small offences.</note> indeed, may offend, and diſpleaſe the partie againſt whom they are ſpoken, but yet they are not ſo great, as to bring any hurt or hindrance to a man, either in his bodie, goods, or good name. As when the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſpake diſdainfully of Chriſt, <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 55.</note>

               <p>Secondly, there are greater wrongs and iniuries, <note place="margin">2 Greater wrongs.</note> which may not onely diſpleaſe and grieue the partie, againſt whom the wrongs are done, but alſo bring ſome hurt, either to his bodie, goods or good name.

               <p>Thirdly, there are wrongs and iniuries which are very manifeſt, and great wrongs, ſuch as touch a man verie <note place="margin">3 Very great and intollerable wrongs.</note> neerely, either in his perſon; when, it may be, his l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe three ſorts of forbearance, are to be ſhewed in all manner of wrongs whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, beſides all this, a Chriſtian is in leſſer <note place="margin">4.

It was the <hi>Corinthians</hi> fault, vpon light occaſions, and for ſmall wrongs, and iniuries, to goe to law one with another: whom the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> reproues, ſaying, <note n="e" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>There is vtterly a fault among you, becauſe ye goe to law one with another: why doe ye not rather take wrong? Why doe ye not rather ſuffer your ſelues to be defrauded?</hi> And if the wrongs &amp; iniuries, which are offered to any one, be of a high nature, in the higheſt degree of wrongs, ſo that the wrongs and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries doe very greatly concerne a man, and neerely touch him in his bodie, goods, or good name; if they be ſuch great wrongs, and iniuries, as doe endanger his life, his eſtate, or his eſtimation and credite, and that of neceſſity, <note place="margin">Rules to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at law.</note> he be conſtrained to defend himſelfe againſt his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie by courſe of law; herein a Chriſtian is to ſhew his patience, in forbearing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, going to law in the firſt place: for it behooues a <note place="margin">1 Not to goe to law in the firſt place.</note> Chriſtian, firſt to labour for peace, and to ſeeke by all meanes, if it be poſſible, to haue ſatisfaction for wrong done, without law: and to vſe the benefite of law onely for neceſſitie, as the laſt remedie: euen as a wounded man is conſtrained at the laſt, when there is no remedie, to ſuffer a member of his bodie to be cut off.</p>
               <p>This going to law in the firſt place, was a fault in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who were reprooued for it by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <p>Secondly, a Chriſtian is to ſhew his patience in forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">2 In forgiuing.</note> wrongs, and iniuries: wherein he is to conſider,</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for the wrong done, we are to obſerue theſe <note place="margin">2 Concerning the wrong done.</note> rules:</p>
               <p>Firſt, if the wrong be of the leaſt ſort of wrongs, and iniuries, then it is a mans wiſedome, and diſcretion to paſſe by it; as <hi>Solamon</hi> counſelleth, <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 19. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>the diſcretion of a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 To paſſe by ſmall offences.</note> 
                  <hi>man deferreth his anger; and it is his glorie to paſſe ouer a tranſgreſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if the wrong and iniurie be ſomewhat grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">2 In greater wrongs, to clear our own innocencie: and then to put vp the wrong.</note> drawing with it ſome little offence to a mans bodie, goods, or good name, but be not of the higheſt degree of wrongs; a man in ſuch a caſe, ought firſt to labour to cleere his owne innocencie and when he hath as much as he can cleared himſelfe, then, he is to ſit downe with the wrong, and patiently to put it vp: an example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue in our Sauiour Chriſt: the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſaid vnto Chriſt, <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 48. 49.</note>

Doth he raile on them, as they did on him? No. Doth he ſeeke any meanes to be auenged on them for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ong done? No. But what did he? The firſt word of diſgrace, <hi>thou art a Samaritane,</hi> as being of the leaſt ſort of wrongs, he paſſed ouer, ſaid nothing of it; but to the other, <hi>thou hast a Deuill,</hi> he anſwered for himſelfe, <hi>I haue not a Deuill:</hi> that which you ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, is vntrue: <hi>I haue not a Deuill: for I honour my father, and you doe diſhonour me.</hi> He cleareth himſelfe of the falſe accuſation; and putteth vp the wrong, commit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting himſelfe to God, that iudgeth righteouſly. This is the behauiour of a Chriſtian concerning leſſer wrongs, and iniuries.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:21095:89"/>
               <p> Thirdly, for wrongs and iniuries of the greateſt ſort, <note place="margin">3 Concerning the greateſt wrongs, and iniuries, a man may lawfully vſe the benefit of law, ſo that it be done ma lawfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> and higheſt nature, ſuch wrongs as doe neerly concerne a mans perſon, touch his life, concerne his eſtate, and greatly tend to the vtter defaming of him; a Chriſtian is not bound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That the Magiſtrate is the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God,</hi> and therefore may lawfully be ſought vnto, S. <hi>Paul</hi> proues both by word, and practiſe: for he ſayth of the Magiſtrate, that <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good: and he is the Miniſter of God, a reuenger, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute wrath vpon him that doth euill.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, when the <hi>Iewes</hi> laid manie, and grieuous complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, which they could not proue, <note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 10. 11</note> 
                  <hi>appealed</hi> to the iudgement ſeat of <hi>Rome,</hi> there to be iudged before <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi> Thus I haue ſhewed, that we are patiently to ſuffer wrongs and iniuries: and how our patience is to ſhew it ſelfe, when wrongs and iniuries are offered vs, and that in all the degrees of wrongs.</p>
               <p>Which ſerues to reproue diuerſe ſorts of people:</p>
               <p>Firſt, thoſe who will forbeare verie little, or no wrong <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> at all, neither in word nor deed: that wil put vp no wrong <note place="margin">1 Againſt priuate reuenge.</note> nor ſuffer any iniurie; but are readie to reuenge euery wrong, to render euill for euill, like for like, one euill word for another, and one euill deede for another. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the rule of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5 15.</note> 
                  <hi>ſee that none render euill for euill to any man.</hi> This reuenging of a mans owne cauſe, rendering euill for euill, is brutiſh and beaſt-like, for ſo doe beaſts gore one another: and ſo doe dogges grinne one at another, barke at, and bite one another. <note place="margin">Reaſons to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But thou that wilſt needs be auenged on thy aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, conſider with thy ſelfe O man, what thou doeſt; For firſt, by reuenging thine owne quarrell, thou doeſt <note place="margin">1 Reuenge more enrageth the aduerſarie.</note> more enrage thine enemie, more ſtirre him vp to anger, and wrath, and bitterneſſe againſt thee.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:21095:89"/>
               <p> Secondly, in reuenging thine owne cauſe, thou vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt <note place="margin">He that reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his owne cauſe, vſurpeth Gods office.</note> Gods authoritie, thou takeſt vpon thy ſelfe Gods office; for it is Gods office to right all wrongs, he is the righteous Iudge: as ſayth the Apoſtle, <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Dearly beloued, auenge not your ſelues, but rather giue place vnto wrath: for, it is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay,</hi> ſaith the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A man that auengeth himſelfe on his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, is like vnto the dogge that runs after the ſtone that <note place="margin">3 Be auenged ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on thine owne ſinnes.</note> is caſt at him, barkes, and bites at the ſtone, and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not the hand that caſt the ſtone: the cauſe of ſtrife and diſſenſion is from the Diuell: the Diuell caſts ſome ſtone of diſſention, to cauſe a man to be offended: and for a mans owne ſinnes, God of times raiſeth vp ſome aduerſarie againſt a man, to vexe, and trouble him, that he may humble him; Doe not thou then with the dog, malitiouſly ſet thy ſelfe againſt thine enemie, ſeeking to be auenged on him, but let thine eies looke to the hand that caſt the ſtone: humble thy ſelfe before God for thine owne ſinnes, which haue deſerued that the ſtone ſhould be caſt at thee: and in any caſe, auenge not thy ſelfe, but commit thy ſelfe, and thy cauſe to God that iudgeth righteouſly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this doctrine of patience in ſuffering <note place="margin">2 A gainſt thoſe that goe to law for ſmall offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the leaſt iniuries.</note> wrongs, in all the ſorts and degrees thereof, reprooues thoſe, who, though they can, it may be, moderate their paſſions in ſome meaſure from raſh anger, and bridle their tongues from reproachfull ſpeeches; yea, and hold their hands from fighting; yet, for ſmall offences, and the leaſt iniuries, will take a courſe by law, and ſue their neighbour, if they haue neuer ſo little aduantage by law; if the wrong done either by word, or deed, will beare an action, then forth with to the law. But it hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that a man ought to vſe the law but for neceſſity; not for euery offence, nor for euery wrong, but for great wrongs, and offences of the higheſt nature. Men ſhould goe to law, as they goe to Phiſicke; if a man ſhould for euery diſtemper in his body, for euery paine and griefe,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21095:90"/> goe to Phiſick, he would in the end bring his body to a low ſtate, and cauſe it to decay: ſo, if a man for euery of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and treſpaſſe, for euery wrong and iniurie, will be running to law, and accuſtome himſelfe to that trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and vnpeaceable courſe of life; he may in the end bring himſelfe to a low ſtate, and cauſe his ſubſtance to decay: wherefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <note n="ſ" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye bite and deuoure one another, take heed ye be not conſumed one of another.</hi> And howſoeuer a contentious, and an vnpeaceable minded man may be perhaps well for his outward ſtate; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his ſoule, he can be in no good ſtate: for a man that is giuen to continuall contentions, and tearmely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of law, hath little quietneſſe of minde; and is in great danger to looſe charity, meekeneſſe, patienc, yea peace of conſcience. The want of this patience in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering wrong, is a great cauſe of ſo many needleſſe, and ſome endleſſe ſuits in law: and thoſe manie times for ſmall wrongs, and iniuries; which, &amp; greater then thoſe, many a patient minded man, would haue bene content to haue put vp. Hence it is, that Courts are ſo full of matters of controuerſie. <note n="t" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſpeake to your ſhame.</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is it ſo that there is not a wiſe man amongſt you? no not one ſhall be able to iudge betweene his brethren?</hi> what? none that is able, or wiſe enough to iudge of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, but you muſt needes goe to law one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? I dare ſay it, that if men had this rare gift of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to ſuffer wrong, at leaſt in ſome meaſure, there would not be ſuch ſuites at law; but matters of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie might be ended, by ſome diſcreet men without law; except they were wrongs of a high nature; as endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering a mans life; or bringing infamie, and reproach to his good name: or except they were trialls of titles of poſſeſſions, and inheritance: other leſſer matters might be ended at home.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here, they alſo are reproued, who are hard-hearted <note place="margin">3 Againſt thoſe that will not forgiue their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</note> againſt thoſe that haue offended them, and will not be moued to forgiue them; and if they doe forgiue
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21095:90"/> them; it is with ſome, but from the lips, &amp; not from the heart. But we ought to forgiue our enemies, <note place="margin">Reaſons to mooue vs,</note> and that freely.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we ought to forgiue our enemies, and that, <note place="margin">1 To forgiue: becauſe</note>

                  <hi>if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi> Now, to be in Chriſt; is, to haue true faith in Chriſt, whereby a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is ingrafted into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is made a member of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and liues in Chriſt, as the branch in the vine: for by faith <hi>Chriſt</hi> liueth in vs, and we in him.

                  <hi>Shewing thereby, that without workes no man can be in Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> is the true vine, and euery faithfull ſoule is a branch of that vine: and is knowne to be in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to haue faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the fruits of a godly life. If any man be in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hauing true, iuſtifying faith, he is alſo ſanctified by the ſpirit of God, he is renued inwardly in his minde, and reformed outwardly in his life, and conuerſation. He is a chang'd man, he is not the ſame man that he was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21095:91"/> before; for his heart is now purified by faith, and his conſcience is purged from dead workes to ſerue the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God: if any man be in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and haue <hi>Chriſt</hi> dwelling in his heart by faith, he hath a new heart, a new mind, a new will, new affections, new deſires, new pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and new reſolutions; he hath new eyes, new eares, a new tongue, new hands, and new feete: all is new: not in regard of the <note n="ſ" place="margin">Nulla ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that before was darke through ignorance, is now inlightned with ſauing knowledge: the will which before was froward, peruerſe, and ſtubborne, is now framed to the will of God: and the affections which were rebellious, diſordered, and diſobedient, in the new creation, are brought into order, and framed to holy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. The eye, that hath offended by wandring, luſting, and coueting; is now made a modeſt, chaſt, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and contented eye. The tongue, that hath either offended God, by blaſphemie, ſwearing, curſing, or any way taking the name of God in vaine; or grieued a mans neighbour, by railing words, reuiling and reproachfull ſpeeches, by lying, ſlandering, backbiting, falſe accuſing, detracting from the credit and eſtimation of others; is now, in the new creation, made to be a tongue honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God, prayſing and bleſſing God: a tongue abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lies, and ſpeaking the truth vnto his neighbour; a tongue ſpeaking well to others, and of others; and of a fierie, inflamed, contentious tongue; it is now, a coole, quiet, and peaceable tongue. The hands alſo that haue offended, by fighting, hurting, wounding, killing; by violence, crueltie, oppreſſion, extortion, robbing, and by being vnmercifully ſhut againſt the poore; in the new creation, and change of life, are made peaceable,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21095:92"/> forbearing, innocent, and harmleſſe; yea, mercifull, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, and open to the poore and needy. And the feet which were ſwift to ſhed bloud, and walked in the waies of wickedneſſe, are now refrained from euery euill way.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of this, that reformation of life, is a ſigne of true faith; hath a two-fold vſe. It ſerues,</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſerues to reprooue thoſe, who vainely <label type="milestone">

But the truth is; if any man be in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he is a new creature; he is a new man; hee hath put off the olde man, which is corrupt, and hath put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and true holineſſe. In the new creation, there is alteration and change, in the minde, in the will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; in the eyes, eares, tongue, hands, &amp;c: then looke vpon thy ſelfe, ô man; ſearch thy ſelfe within, and view thy ſelfe without; is thy minde the ſame that it hath beene formerly? doth it ſtill mind earthly things? is thy heart as much ſet vpon the world, as euer it was? are thy affections as diſordered, and thy paſſions as vnruly, as in former-time? and doe thy olde corruptions remaine in their full ſtrength? is there no change, nor alteration in the inner man? and the eye the ſame that it hath been? as Iuſtfull, as wanton and wandring, as coueting as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?

                  </gap>uſt and vnconſcionable dealing? and perceiueſt thou no change? is there no reformation, nor amendment of life? is thy heart as corrupt as before? thy eye as wicked as before? thy tongue as diuelliſh as before? and thy hands as cruell and catching as before? iudge heereby, in what a dangerous ſtate thou remaineſt, as long as thou thus remaineſt, not changed, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, nor reformed. For whoſoeuer findes in himſelfe no alteration from euill, nor reformation of his former euill courſe, nor any good change of life; hee is no new creature: and if he be not a new creature, then he is not in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> if hee be not in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then hath hee no true faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; whoſoeuer hath not true faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> cannot be ſaued. So that without reformation, there is no ſaluation. By this, then, the prophane, wicked, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man may ſee his danger: the common ordinary ſwearer, the prophaner of the Saboth, the contemner of Gods Word, the diſobedient, the cruell, malicious, and vnmercifull man, the proud, the formcator and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, the drunkard, the couetous, the oppreſſour, the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer and extortioner, the falſe accuſer, the ſlanderer, &amp;c? theſe, and ſuch like, may all ſee their fearefull and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtate, none of which, as long as they are ſuch, can ſay truely, that they are in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> neither haue they true faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they are not new creatures: for had they true faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they would ſhew ſome good ſigne of their faith: and this is a plaine and euident ſigne of faith, to bee a <hi>new creature,</hi> to forſake our old conuerſation, and hence-forward to liue in newneſſe of life. The conſideration whereof, ought to bee of force, to rowze vp the dull ſpirits of all ſuch as are yet a ſleepe

                  <hi>depart from me, ye curſed, into euerlaſting fire, prepared for the Deuill and his Angels. For, I was an hungred, and yee gaue me no meat: I was thirſtie, and ye gaue me no drinke: I was a ſtranger, and ye tooke me not in: naked, and ye cloathed me not: ſicke, and in priſon, and ye viſitted me not.</hi> So that not onely the committing of great ſinnes, of vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe againſt our brethren, as taking away from them, by violence, or any manner of wrong-dealing, their lands, liuings, houſes, fields; or oppreſſing them with heauie burdens, &amp;c. but the verie omitting of the neceſſarie duties of charitie, not giuing part of that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which God hath giuen vs, to the relieuing of the poore; the verie ſtopping of our eares at the cry of the poore: the cloſing of out hands againſt the poore, and the ſhutting vp of the bowels of compaſſion from them that are in miſerie, and diſtreſſe, is able to caſt ſoule and bodie into hell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing that workes of mercie and deedes <note place="margin">2 Againſt the neglect and want of Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalitie.</note> of charitie, are teſtimonies of true, iuſtifying, and ſauing faith; this iuſtly reprooues the want of hoſpitalitie, and the great decay of auncient houſe-keeping. In theſe daies we may ſee many great, and faire houſes, but in few of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21095:97"/> them any good houſe-keeping: Great houſes haue both ſtrait and wide gates, but ſeldome open: many chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but few fires. Now, that Hoſpitalitie ought to be maintained; the Scripture is verie plaine for it. S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth all Chriſtians generally, (as their abilitie will reach) to <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <hi>diſtribute to the neceſſitie of Saints, and to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to hoſpitalitie. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter</hi> alſo exhorteth vs to <note n="m" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 9.</note>

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 2. &amp;c.</note>

                  <hi>not eat his morſell himſelfe alone, but the fatherleſſe did eat thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, vpon diligent inquirie, what ſhouldbet he cauſe <note place="margin">The cauſe of the decay of Hoſpitalitie in our Land.</note> that hoſpitality is much decaied in our land: I can finde no other cauſe but Sinne, and the iudgement of God vpon men, and their houſes for Sinne. If this be too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <note place="margin">1 In generall. Sinne.</note> an anſwere; I come to particulars, and affirme, that firſt, one cauſe of the decay of auncient hoſpitalitie, is, contentious ſuing at law: from whence, it commeth <note place="margin">2 In particular.</note> to paſſe, that both he that ſue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h, and he that is ſued; he that troubleth, and he that is troubled, is made more <note place="margin">1 Contentious ſuing a: law.</note> vnable to maintaine hoſpitalitie. It were good, that ſuch would be warned by that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <note n="r" place="margin">

                  <hi>If yee bite and deuoure one another, take heed ye be not conſumed one of another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, another cauſe is exceſſe in eating, &amp; drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <note place="margin">2 Exceſle in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> gluttonie and drunkenneſſe: whereby, many are brought to ſuch a poore ſtate, and beggerly condition, that they are not able to keepe hoſpitalitie. Of this, <hi>Sola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:21095:98"/> ſaith, <note n="ſ" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The third cauſe, is Whoredome. <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Adulterie, <note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 31. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>it is a fire that conſumeth to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3 Whoredome.</note> 
                  <hi>and will root out all a mans encreaſe.</hi> The voluptuous, riotous prodigall, miſpends ſo much in reuelling, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting, drinking, and whoring; that all that he can rake, and ſcrape from his poore, ract-tenants, is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to maintaine himſelfe; much leſſe to keepe hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie.</p>
               <p>The fourth, is Pride in apparell: when men weare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell <note place="margin">4 Pride in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</note> paſt decencie, and goe farre aboue their degree. This Pride is a deuourer. They carry ſo much wealth vpon their owne backes, that the poore are robd, and pincht both of backe and bellie.</p>
               <p>The fift, is violence and oppreſſion: when men enter <note place="margin">5 Oppreſſion.</note> vniuſtly into the poſſeſſions, and inheritance of other men: this puls downe the iudgement of God vpon their owne heads. <note n="u" place="margin">

                  <hi>Woe vnto them,</hi> ſayth the Prophet <hi>Eſay, that ioyne houſe to houſe, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midſt of the earth: in mine eares ſaith the Lord of hoſts, of a truth many houſes ſhall be deſolate, euen great and faire without inhabitant.</hi> All faire, and ſtately houſes are not ſo happie, as to enioy the end of their building, habitation: much leſſe, hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
               <p>The ſixt, is Sacriledge: worldly, and vnconſcionable <note place="margin">6 Sacriledge.</note> minded men thinke, if they can with-hold and keepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing backe from Church-men, thoſe ſheaues, and thoſe tithes will helpe well towards the maintenance of their houſe-keeping, and make them more able to keepe hoſpitalitie: but its quite contrarie: for the tithes, and ſheaues vniuſtly with-held, and vnconſcionably taken from the Church; are ſo laid vp in the barnes, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of thoſe that ſpoile the Church, that they ſecretly, though the iuſt iudgement of God, eat into, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21095:98"/> the reſt of their wealth and ſubſtance. Like as <note n="x" place="margin">

                  <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans</hi> wedge of gold which he tooke, being <hi>conſecrated vnto the Lord,</hi> was the cauſe of the deſtruction of all that <hi>he had.</hi> And although many Lay-men, haue great, year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-profites comming in, by vniuſt gathered tithes, yet, (ſee the iudgement of God vpon them) they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by neuer a whit the richer: but rather in poorer ſtate then their aunceſtours, who kept as great, or greater hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie then they doe, and yet robd no Churches. So that their deuouring of conſecrated things, doth no whit helpe their hoſpitality; and it hinders Church-men from keeping that hoſpitalitie, which otherwiſe they might, and ought. Againſt this Sacriledge, the Lord himſelfe complaines by the Prophet <hi>Malachie,</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 3 8. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Will a man robbe God? Yet ye haue robbed me. But yee ſay, wherein haue we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are curſed with a curſe.</hi> He ſaith not barely, <hi>ye are curſed,</hi> but <hi>ye are curſed with a curſe.</hi> He doubleth the curſe, to ſhew the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and greatneſſe of the curſe: Whoſoeuer robs God of his tithes, and offerings, drawes a curſe vpon himſelfe: when he binds vp the ſheafe vniuſtly taken, he binds in the curſe, and when he layes it vp in his barne, he layes vp the curſe with it: and the curſed ſheafe eats in, and ſpreads it ſelfe into the reſt of the ſheaues, and corne, and ſubſtance: like the plague of Leproſie, infecting all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the true cauſes of the decay, and preſent want of Hoſpitalitie. Now, if there be no Hoſpitalitie; then mercie and compaſſion is not ſhewed to the poore and needie, to the ſtrangers, to the fatherleſſe, and wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes: and if mercy and charitie be not ſhewed, at leaſt, in ſome ſort, and in ſome meaſure, more or leſſe, as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans abilitie will extend, I demand then, Where is Faith? Is that true Faith that hath no workes? Can that Faith ſaue? Nay. For <note n="z" place="margin">

Nay, you ought not to faint, nor be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in the profeſſion of godlineſſe, nor yet to be afraid to confeſſe Chriſt before men, though you ſuffer for the name of Chriſt; for this is the portion of the righteous in this life, to be afflicted, perſecuted, and troubled; and concerning this, I ſay with S. <hi>Peter,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Shewing what Repentance is.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>REpentance is a gift of God, whereby a ſinner, <note place="margin">1 What Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is.</note> through the feare of God, is changed in his minde, and turned from ſinne vnto God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, that Repentance is a gift of God: <note place="margin">1 A gift of God.</note> for ſo the Scripture makes it. For in the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, it is ſayd, <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>God hath alſo to the Gentiles granted Repentance vnto life.</hi> And to <hi>Timothy, S. Paul</hi> ſaith, <note n="b" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>If God peraduenture will giue them repentance to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the truth.</hi> Heere, by Gods <hi>granting and giuing</hi> repentance, it is apparent, that Repentance is the gift of God.</p>
               <p>Next, in the definition of Repentance, there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <note place="margin">2 The feare of God. In the firſt conuerſion of a ſinner, diuers things concur.</note> the <hi>feare of God,</hi> moouing the ſinner to repent. In the act of Repentance, euen in the firſt conuerſion of a ſinner, there are diuerſe things concurre.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is the gracious working of God, who, by his holy Spirit doth ſoften the heart of a ſinner, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him grace to conuert, and to turne from ſinne vnto <note place="margin">1 Gods holy Spirit, by which God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ſinner grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</note> God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is the working of that feare, which is called the <hi>ſeruile feare;</hi> whereby, a ſinner is mooued and ſtirred, is vexed and diſquieted in himſelfe, for feare of puniſhment; and is euen terrefied and affrighted with the hideous ſight of his abominable ſinnes, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <note place="margin">2 Seruile feare.</note> of Gods iudgement for ſinne. when he ſeeth Hell gaping to deuoure him: which horrible feare, though in the wicked and reprobate, it be a torment, and able to bring them to deſparation; as it was in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Iudas:</hi> yet in the children of God, this legall terror and affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſinners with the feare of puniſhment, may bee a preparation to receiue grace; when as they are truely humbled for their ſinnes, vnder the ſence and feeling of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21095:106"/> Gods anger and diſpleaſure againſt ſinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the working of Faith; whereby the ſinner <note place="margin">3 Faith.</note> beginnes to looke vnto Chriſt, and beleeues the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſinnes, at the leaſt, beleeues that his ſinnes are pardonable.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the working of hope; whereby the ſinner <note place="margin">4 Hope.</note> receiues hope of the remiſſion of his ſinne, hoping that through the mercy of God, and merits of Chriſt, his ſinnes ſhall be forgiuen.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the working of that feare, which is called the <note place="margin">5 Filiall feare.</note> 
                  <hi>filiall,</hi> or childe-like <hi>feare;</hi> wherby the ſinner is now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with himſelfe, in regard of this, that hee hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, who hath beene ſo good and gracious a God vnto him, to ſpare him ſo long, giuing him ſo long time and ſpace of repentence, and offering him mercy in Chriſt Ieſus: and now he beginnes to feare God, not ſo much for feare of puniſhment, as out of reuerence, awe, and loue of God: who hath ſo loued him, as not onely to forbeare him in the time of his ignorance &amp; wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when he deſerued rather to haue been cut off, and caſt from the preſence of the Lord into vtter darkneſſe; but hath ſent his onely Sonne <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> to be his Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Redeemer, to ſhed his bloud to ſaue his ſinfull ſoule; in gratefull remembrance heereof, he is reſolued now hence forward, to deny himſelfe, to renounce the world, to forſake his former ſinfull courſe of life, and to turne himſelfe vnto the Lord, to ſerue him in holines and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of his life; and this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he feares God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in Repentance, I ſay, that a ſinner is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <note place="margin">3 Change of minde.</note> in his minde. There are two words vſed in the new Teſtament, which ſignifie <note n="c" place="margin">

               <p>Laſtly, in Repentance, there is a turning from ſinne, <note place="margin">4 Turning from ſinne to God.</note> and a turning vnto God. But of this, more in the next place.</p>
               <p>Now, whereas Repentance is, (as hath beene proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) <label type="milestone">

But conſider, I be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeech you, ô yee ſecure and careleſſe people; know yee, and conſider well with your ſelues, that repentance is not in any mans power, no man can repent when hee will: for Repentance is the gift of God, and it is of the gracious working of Gods Holy Spirit, that a ſinner is changed in minde, and turned from ſinne, vnto God. Wherefore in <hi>Ieremy, Ephraim</hi> is brought in lamenting, and praying, <note n="f" place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, though a ſinner in his very firſt conuerſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be capable of repentance, that is, God giuing him repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he may repent: yet the truth is, a ſinner cannot of himſelfe with all his wit and knowledge; and by all his naturall parts which he hath, come to true and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repentance, except God giue him grace to repent: by which grace of God, the ſinner may then will his own conuerſion: for at the ſame inſtant, when God giueth repentance, he alſo giueth the ſinner grace, to will his own conuerſion: but that will of man is not of himſelfe, but of God.

                  <hi>the ſorrow of the world, or worldly ſorrow, which worketh death.</hi> Godly ſorrow worketh repentance, but worldly ſorrow worketh death: for a ſinner being detected, and his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe found out; the Law of God hauing laid open his ſinne, and wounded his conſcience, he ſtands as one terrified with the remembrance of his deſerued puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: now his conſcience witneſſeth againſt him, that he hath done wickedly, that hee deſerues puniſhment, and cannot eſcape the iudgement of God.

               <p>The one, is the gracious working of the Spirit of God: giuing a ſinner a liuely ſence and feeling of his ſinnes; giuing him grace to ſee and know how by his <note place="margin">1 By the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</note> ſinnes he hath offended God, and grieued the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ming alſo his hard heart, that hee may greeue, lament, and mourne for his ſinnes after a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner. This is that which the Lord ſaith by his Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi>

                  <hi>his onely ſonne.</hi> A ſinner looking vpon Chriſt, whom by his ſinnes he hath pierced and wounded, and hauing a true feeling of his ſinnes, greeueth and mourneth, he is ſorry after a godly manner: but how is this godly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row wrought in him? the Lord ſaith, that he will <hi>powre the ſpirit of grace, and of ſupplications,</hi> vpon the ſinnefull ſoule; and when the Lord hath put ſuch grace into the ſoule of a ſinner, to ſee his ſinnes, and to perceiue, how that by his ſinnes hee hath offended God, and pierced the Sonne of God; then hee is inwardly grieued at the heart, then his heart melts into teares. This is the firſt meanes whereby a ſinner is brought to Contrition.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meanes, is the preaching of <hi>Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 By preaching Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied.</note> as appeareth in the example of thoſe firſt Conuerts, to whom <hi>Peter</hi> preached Chriſt crucified.

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>They were pricked in their hearts, and ſayd vnto Peter, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and brethren, what ſhall wee doe?</hi> their conſciences were ſo ſtricken with the terrour of this, that they ſhould be guilty of ſhedding the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud of the Sonne of God, that they were at their wits end, they knew not what to doe; yet were they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to finde eaſe to their troubled conſciences, but knew not how, till they called to remembrance the words of the Apoſtle, how that <hi>Ieſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> whom they had crucified and ſlaine, was the Sonne of God, whom God raiſed vp, who aſcended to Heauen, and is exalted at the right hand of God: and hearing alſo, that he is <hi>Ieſus the Sauiour,</hi> that he is the true <hi>Meſſias, Chriſt,</hi> the Anoynted of the Lord; heereupon they are <hi>pricked in their hearts,</hi> and touched in their conſciences, with a feeling of their ſinnes; yet ſo, as they doe not deſpaire of all mercy, but truſting in the goodneſſe and mercy of God through Chriſt, and being deſirous to know how they may finde comfort to their troubled conſciences, they ſaid to <hi>Peter and to the reſt of the Apoſtles, Menand brethen, what ſhall we doe?</hi> ô teach vs, what we muſt doe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21095:116"/> to be ſaued. Now, they are ſorrowfull after a godly manner; now, they are of a contrite ſpirit, and an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoule; now, they are exceeding ſorrowfull, that they haue crucified the Lord of life; now, they haue bleeding hearts, for that they haue ſhed the bloud of the innocent Lambe of God; now, they are exceedingly diſpleaſed with themſelues, for that they haue done ſo wickedly; and now, they ſo abhorre their ſinnes and wickedneſſe, that they purpoſe neuer to doe wickedly againe. So that their <hi>compunction</hi> was not onely a bare <hi>pricking of the heart,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> had; but as they had a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their ſinnes, ſo alſo had they a feeling of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Moreouer, to the <hi>compunction and pricking of their hearts,</hi> there was ioyned a readineſſe to obey the will of God, and to doe whatſoeuer the Lord ſhould command them; and therefore it is, that they ſay, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we doe?</hi> to the end that a ſinner may be brought to Contrition; its neceſſary, that the Word of God, which is <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>quicke and powerfull, and ſharper then any two-edged ſword, piercing euen to the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a ſunder of ſoule and ſpirit, and of the ioynts and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart;</hi> doe pierce the heart, and wound the conſcience, making the ſinner to feele his ſinnes, to know, that by his ſinnes he hath offended God, who hath beene ſo gracious a God, and ſo louing and mercifull a Father vnto him; and to acknowledge, that by his ſinnes, he hath pierced and wounded the Sonne of God, who was content to be pierced and wounded, yea, and to ſuffer his bloud to be ſhed for his ſinnes. The Adamant, the hardeſt ſtone, which will neither bee bruized with iron, nor melted with fire, is notwithſtanding diſſolued with <note n="l" place="margin">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:21095:116"/> Thus Contrition is wrought in the heart.</p>
               <p>The third thing, is concerning the ſignes and marks <note place="margin">3 Signes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward godly ſorrow.</note> of Contrition.</p>
               <p>Contrition, or inward godly ſorrow, is knowen by the Effects thereof, namely, ſuch things as it worketh in vs: and they are ſeuen; mentioned by the Apoſtle to the Corinthians, <note n="m" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11.</note>

               <p>Secondly, greater ſinnes muſt haue greater ſorrow; <note place="margin">2 For great ſinns we muſt haue great ſorrow.</note> more mourning and more weeping. <hi>Dauid</hi> was ſorrie for his leſſer ſinnes, but was exceedingly ſorrowfull for his great tranſgreſſions. <note n="h" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5.</note>

                  <hi>put him in priſou.</hi> But ſuch is not the repentance of the children of God; for they do not only humble themſelues, and confeſſe their ſinnes, but they forſake their ſinnes, they ceaſe to doe euill, and ſinne no more.

               <p>Secondly, by continuing in ſinne, the ſoule growes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> worſe: for by a continuall committing of ſinne, there is a continuall decaying of grace, and the harder will it be to repaire againe the ſpirituall ſtate of the ſoule.

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing concerning amendment of life, is, <note place="margin">2 After what manner amend ment of life is wrought in a ſinner.</note> How, and after what manner this bleſſed change of life is wrought in a ſinner. Reformation or amendment of life is wrought thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt, before amendment of life, there muſt goe an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained forſaking of our former euill conuerſation: wee <note place="margin">1 There muſt be an vtter forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our old euill conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> muſt firſt die to ſinne, before we can be quickened to a new life: we muſt firſt ceaſe from dead workes, before we can doe good workes.

               <p>Secondly, amendment of life is wrought in the whole <note place="margin">2 It muſt be in the whole man.</note> man: in ſoule, and in bodie: in the minde, in the will, and affections; in the cogitations and thoughts of the heart; in the eye, in the eare, in the tongue, and in the hands; in life and conuerſation. As the mind muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, ſo the life muſt be reformed.</p>

                  <hi>cleanſe firſt that which it within the cup and platter, that the outſide of them may be cleane alſo.</hi> The reaſon of this, is becauſe the heart of a ſinner not yet renewed, nor ſanctified, is no better then a filthie puddle, ſending forth ſtinking ſmels and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſauours; &amp; like a corrupt fountaine, from whence floweth vnſauorie and vnwholeſome water.

                  <hi>Out of the heart proceede euill thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornication, thefts, falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, blaſphemies.</hi> Wherefore, reformation and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life muſt neceſſarily beginne within: whoſoeuer would amend his life, muſt firſt cleanſe his heart.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeares, both by what meanes, and alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner, amendment of life is wrought in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

               <p>Firſt, the Scripture doth make it manifeſt, that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is not onely to repent of his ſinnes paſt, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his former ſinfull life, but he muſt alſo change his <note place="margin">1 God requireth it.</note> euill courſe, amend his life, and lead a new life.

               </head>
               <p>THe ſixt and laſt ſtep of grace, whereby a Sinner <note place="margin">6 Perſeuerance in grace; or, continuing in well-doing to the end.</note> in his returning from ſinne, riſeth higher, and continueth neerer vnto God; is perſeuerance in grace and goodneſſe, when a Chriſtian, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing begun well, holds on his good courſe, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues therein to the end.</p>
               <p>Concerning this perſeuerance; I will <note place="margin">Therein, two things.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, prooue that a Chriſtian may perſeuere, and continue to the end.</p>
               <p>Secondly, vſe motiues and perſwaſions, to mooue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:21095:139"/> good Chriſtian to labour, that hee may perſeuere and continue in goodneſſe euen vnto the end.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: That a Chriſtian, hauing faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, <note place="margin">1 A Chriſtian may perſeuere, and continue to the end. For</note> and grace to repent of his ſins, hauing forſaken his ſinnes and amended his life, and now being in the ſtate of grace; may ſo perſeuere, and continue to the end, is euident; for</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Scripture teſtifieth, that ſuch a one ſhall not <note place="margin">1 The Scripture affirmeth that a good and ſound Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſhall not be mooued.</note> be mooued from his ſtanding in grace. <note n="a" place="margin">

                     </gap> remoeued, but abideth for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, God that hath begunne the good worke of grace in his children, will finiſh it: So ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begunne, a good worke in you, will performe it</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 God that hath begunne grace will finiſh it.</note> 
                  <hi>vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, God will glorifie them that are iuſtified from their ſinnes: As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſpeakes to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Moreouer, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3 They that are iuſtified ſhall be glorified.</note> 
                  <hi>and whom he called, them he alſo iuſtified: and whom he iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, An inheritance in heauen is reſerued for the elect, and they are kept by the power of God vnto <note place="margin">4 The elect are reſerued vnto ſaluation in heauen.</note> ſaluation: So ſaith S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which according to his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mercie, hath begotten vs againe vnto a liuely hope, by the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt from the dead, to an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance incorruptible, and vndefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerued in heauen for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith vnto ſaluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, this being prooued that a Chriſtian may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere, <note place="margin">2 Motiues to perſwade to Perſeuerance.</note> and continue to the end. In the ſecond place, it is expedient to vſe perſwaſions, whereby euery good Chriſtian may bee mooued to labour for perſeuerance, that hee may continue in his good ſtate of grace, and hold on his right courſe of godlines euen vnto the end.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:21095:139"/> And the perſwaſions hereunto are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God requireth it. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">1 God requireth it.</note> their good affections to heare, and obey the word of the Lord, the Lord commended them, ſaying, <note n="f" place="margin">

Two-fold.</note> is, doing euill, and eſcaping puniſhment. And that both in regard of ſinners themſelues, who ſinne, and doe eſcape puniſhment for a time; and alſo of others, whom they perceiue to ſinne and doe wickedly, and yet ſee no euill befall them: of both which, <hi>Solomon</hi> thus ſpeaketh <note n="a" place="margin">

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:21095:146"/> them, though they liue ſo ſtill: this is a great deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne; for although God be ſo patient to ſuffer ſinners, yea, to ſuffer long, and to waite for their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet ſure it is, if they repent not, the Lord will bring all their ſinnes to remembrance, and will not ſuffer the ſinner to goe vnpuniſhed. And ſo God tels the wicked man, <note n="b" place="margin">

A ſinner that goeth on ſtill in his wickedneſſe, becauſe God doth not execute iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon him for his wickedneſſe, is like vnto a young theefe, who, hauing ſtollen once, or twice, and eſcaped; is encouraged to ſteale ſtill, thinking that he ſhall euer eſcape: but in the end he is taken, and payeth for all.

               </head>
               <p>HOpe of long life, is the fourth impediment of <note place="margin">4 Hope of long life.</note> Repentance: This hope hinders many men from repentance; but this their hope is a vaine hope; and men build this their vaine hope vpon a very weake and deceaueable foundation: Some vpon their yong age; ſome, vpon the ſtrength of their body; and others, vpon the pure and good complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: One reaſons thus, I neede not repent yet, I am but young, I am in my youthfull dayes, in the prime of my age, in my flouriſhing yeares, I hope to liue yet many yeares; I ſhall haue time enough to repent hereafter; it will be time enough for mee to repent when olde age commeth. Another thus, I feele my body to be ſtrong and luſty; I am healthfull, I haue no paine, nor ake, I feele no infirmity, neither am I troubled with any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; I ſhall liue long, I neede not repent yet; it will be time enough for me to repent when my ſtrength faileth, when I feele my ſelfe grow weake, and when ſickneſſe commeth vpon me. Another thus, I am of a pure and good complection, of a ruddie countenance, death will not come neere me, I may take my pleaſure yet a long time: And as for repentance, when I beginne to waxe pale and wanne, and when I perceiue wrinkles to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in my face, then I will repent. Thus fooliſh are we, to put off our repentance till olde age, till the day of death, and till the laſt houre. But grant, that God ſuffer the ſinner to liue in his vngodly courſe of life, euen till he be olde, yet he will hope ſtill to liue a little longer; there's no man ſo olde, but thinkes he may liue yet one yeare longer: So vainely doe men pleaſe themſelues with the hope of long life: And this hope of long life

Ionah</hi> the Prophet is ſent to <hi>Niniueh,</hi> to threaten them and their Cittie with deſtruction and ouerthrow, except they did repent within the ſpace of fortie dayes. <note n="c" place="margin">

                  <hi>Yet fortie dayes, and</hi> Niniueh <hi>ſhall he ouerthrowne,</hi> But vpon this threatning, <hi>Niniueh</hi> did repent: for the King and the whole Cittie put on <hi>ſackcloth and faſted, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mightily vnto God, and repented of their euill wayes, and</hi>

                  <hi>God ſaw their workes that they turned from their euill wayes. And God repented of the euill that he had ſaid hee would doe vnto them, and he did it not.</hi> When God ſaw the people repent of their ſinnes, he repented of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he had threatned againſt them. According to that ſaying of the Lord in <hi>Ieremie,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">

                  <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeake concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdome, to plucke vp and to pull downe, and to deſtroy it: if that nation against whom I haue pronounced, turne from their euill, I will repent of the euill that I thought to doe vnto them.</hi> Thus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance remooueth temporall iudgements.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Repentance remooueth ſpirituall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <note place="margin">2 Spirituall.</note> as blindneſſe of minde, hardneſſe of heart, and horrour of conſcience. It remooues blindneſſe of mind; When God giueth the grace of illumination: for before that a ſinner beleeueth, and repenteth, he liues in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and darkneſſe; but beleeuing, and repenting, he is
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:21095:164"/> inlightned with the knowledge of the truth, and walkes no more in darkeneſſe, but in light; as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeakes, <note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>ye were ſometimes darkneſſe, but now are ye light in the Lord.</hi> Repentance alſo remooueth hardneſſe of heart; when God giueth the ſinner true contrition, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the hard heart: For when God giueth grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, he giueth alſo a mollified and melting heart; as it is ſaid in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>I will ſprinckle cleane water vpon you, and ye ſhall be cleane: from all your filthineſſe, and from all your Idoles will I cleanſe you. A new heart alſo will I giue you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtonie heart out of your fleſh, and I will giue you an heart of fleſh.</hi> Yea, Repentance alſo remooueth horrour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the intollerable burden of ſinne; when God giueth to the penitent ſinner, peace of conſcience, and reſt to the ſoule. <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Come vnto me,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour, <hi>all ye that labour, and are heauie laden, and I will giue you reſt.</hi> Now, the conſcience neuer hath true peace neither doth the ſoule euer enioy quiet reſt, til ſinne be done away by Repentance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Repentance remooueth eternall iudgements: <note place="margin">3 Eternall.</note> ſo that neither death, nor hell, nor condemnation can hurt them that doe truly beleeue in Chriſt, and haue vnfainedly repented of their ſinnes, and doe now lead a new life.

                  <hi>There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Ieſus, who walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>Moreouer, if the Lord lay vpon thee ſpirituall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, afflicting thy ſoule, and wounding thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the bitter remembrance of thy ſinnes; the way to finde reſt, and comfort to thy ſoule, is, to ſeeke to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by faith and repentance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing thy ſinnes, and earneſtly ſuing for the pardon of thy ſinnes; that ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> may giue thee reſt. And if thou ſtandeſt in feare of hell, and condemnation, if thou bee fearefull of that lake of fire; the way and meanes to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape hell and condemnation, is, now to repent of thy ſinnes; now, to cleanſe thy heart from wickedneſſe; now, to riſe from the death of ſinne, to the life of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; and now, to haue thy part and portion in the firſt reſurrection, and then the ſecond death ſhal I haue no power ouer thee. In a word; if we would be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the wrath of God, in this life; and ſaued from hell, and condemnation, in the life to come; we muſt now repent, and returne to the Lord: now, be renewed in minde, and reformed in life, or elſe we cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>

               <p>The firſt, is Idolatrie, worſhipping of Idoles in ſtead <note place="margin">1 Idolatrie.</note> of the true God: Of this, the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſaith, <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iere.</hi> 11. 13. 14</note>

Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift vp a cry or prayer for them: for I will not heare them in the time that they cry vnto me for their trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond, is crueltie, vnmercifulneſſe, blood-guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe. <note place="margin">2 Crueltie, and vnmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> Of this the Lord ſaith, by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi>

                  <hi>When ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many Prayers, I will not heare: your hands are full of blood.</hi> Becauſe they had bloudie hands, and were not waſhed from their hainous tranſgreſſions, therefore the Lord would not heare them.</p>
               <p>The third, is wrath: of which the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>I will</hi>

               <p>The fourth, is vain-glory: this was the fault of thoſe <note place="margin">4 Vaine glorie.</note> hypocrites, of whom our Sauiour warneth his Diſciples to beware. <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>When thou prayeſt, thou ſhalt not be as the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are: for they loue to pray ſtanding in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreets, that they may be ſeene of men. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erily I ſay vnto you, they haue their reward.</hi> If men pray for this end to be ſeene of men, and heard of men, and that they may haue prayſe of men, they may haue the reward which they looke for, men may commend them: but they haue no reward from God: their vain glorie hinders the ſucceſſe of their requeſts, and makes their

               <p>The fift, is hypocriſie: when men pray vnto God fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, <note place="margin">5 Hypocriſie.</note> not in truth of heart. Of this the Lord complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi>

               <p>The ſixt, is want of pittie and compaſſion, not ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">6 Want of pittie and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> mercie to the poore and needie: of this <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <note n="m" place="margin">

               </p>

If through crueltie, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, vnmercifulneſſe, &amp;c. thou haſt bloudie hands; O waſh thee, and make thee cleane; leſt the Lord haue no delight in thee, but hide his eyes, and deny to heare thee, though thou makeſt manie Prayers. Take heede that thou come not before the Lord to pray vnto him, hauing wrath, and hatred, malice, and grudging againſt thy brother; leſt thou prouoke the Lord to wrath againſt thy ſelfe. Beware of vain-glorie; leſt when thou prayeſt, thou goe away vnrewarded. And ſee thou purge thy heart of the leauen of hypocriſie; leſt it be laid to thy charge, that thou draweſt neere vnto God with thy lips, when thy heart is farre from him. Further, if thou wilt haue the Lord to heare thy prayer, and hearken vnto thy crie; ſee that thou turne not thy face from any poore man, and ſtop not thine eares at the crie of the diſtreſſed ſoule; leſt the Lord ſtop his eares at thy crie. And if thou wilt haue God to heare thee when thou ſpeakeſt vnto him by Prayer, ſee that thou refuſe not to heare God ſpeaking vnto thee by Preaching. For if thou make light account of Gods word, when he ſpeaketh vnto thee by Preaching; be well aſſured, that God will make as light account of thy words, when thou ſpeakeſt vnto him by Prayer. The theefe muſt repent of his ſtealing, the murtherer of his blood ſhed, the adulterer of his whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

                  <hi>I bow my knees vnto the Father our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus it is euident by the Scriptures, that we are to make our prayers vnto God, and to call vpon the name of the Lord. And as we are to pray vnto God, and to call vpon the name of the Lord. So,</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to make our prayers to God alone, <note place="margin">2 To God alone, and to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</note> and to none other: This likewiſe the Scripture maketh manifeſt; <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <note n="f" place="margin">

               <p>The third thing yet remaineth; which is, to ſhew <note place="margin">3 Reaſons wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are to pray vnto Go and to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> wherefore we ought to make our praiers vnto God, and to him alone: The reaſons are theſe,</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we haue not onely Gods commandement, bidding vs call vpon him, but we haue alſo his promiſe for audience: if we call vpon him in our trouble, he hath <note place="margin">2 God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to heare vs</note> promiſed to heare vs, and to deliuer vs out of trouble So hath the Lord ſaid, <note n="k" place="margin">

                  <hi>eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous, and his eares are open to their cry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are ſure that the Lord our God is both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <note place="margin">3 God is both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and willing to heare vs.</note> and alſo willing to heare vs: able; for <note n="q" place="margin">

                  <hi>the Lord is nigh to all that call vpon him, to all that call vpon him in truth.</hi> Wherefore, I conclude, that we are to make our prayers to none other in heauen, or in earth, but to God, and to him alone. <label type="milestone">

               <p>Secondly, It hath beene prooued, that if we pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">2 Wee haue no promiſe of helpe from any Saint.</note> to God, he promiſeth to heare vs, and to deliuer vs; but we haue no promiſe in the word of God, that any of the Saints, no not the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> her ſelfe will, or can, helpe, and deliuer vs in the time of our trouble.</p>

As for the iuſt and righteous, he doubts not but their ſoules goe ſtraight to Paradiſe, to Heauen; as the ſoules of the Apoſtles, Martyrs, &amp;c. As for the wicked and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:21095:180"/> vngodly, impenitent ſinners, and Infidels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee maketh no queſtion of them, but that they goe downe to Hell, neuer to be deliuered. All the queſtion is, of the third ſort; thoſe of the middle ſort, which are <hi>neither very good, nor very euill;</hi> but ſuch as die in their veniall ſinnes, or haue not ſatisfied for the temporall puniſhment of their mortall ſinnes; and therefore ſuch muſt be caſt into the fire of <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> to purge them more from their ſins, and as it were to ſcoure away their droſſe, till they haue ſatisfied the iuſtice of God, partly by their owne ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; and partly by the prayers, faſtings, almeſdeeds of others, and ſuch like. This is the Faith of the preſent Romane Church concerning Prayer for the dead: ſo that the praiers of the Romiſts which they make for the dead, are chiefely intended for the ſoules of their friends in <hi>Purgatorie;</hi> that thereby they may procure ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of their paines, and bring (as they imagine) ſome eaſe to their tormented ſoules.</p>

                  <hi>all men did ſay that the Emperour was bleſſed, and accepted of God.</hi> It is manifeſt then, by theſe Fathers, that the cuſtome of the auncient Church of God in praying for the dead, was not to procure eaſe, &amp; to bring refreſhing to their ſoules in <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> or to deliuer them out of <hi>Purgatorie;</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they acknowledge, that their friends for whom they prayed, were in <hi>light;</hi> were in <hi>glorie;</hi> and were <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the third place, I yeeld theſe reaſons, wherefore we are not to pray for the dead, as the Romiſts vſe Prayer for the dead at this day.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Scripture acknowledgeth but two places, as receptacles for the ſoules of men after this life, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi> and <hi>Hell:</hi> either to be with <hi rend="sup">h</hi> 
                  <hi>Diues</hi> in hell torments, <note place="margin">1 The Scripture acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth but two places after this life.</note> or with <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abrahams boſome,</hi> that is, in ioy and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:21095:181"/> felicity: now they that are in heauen, are in ſo great ioyes alreadie, that they cannot be bettered, till the day of the reſurrection, when they ſhall haue fulneſſe of glory both in bodie and ſoule: and they that are in hell, cannot by <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 22. 23</note> any prayers be deliuered thence; as <hi>Abraham</hi> tells <hi>Diues,</hi>

                  <hi>betweene vs and you there is a great gulfe fixed, ſo that they which would paſſe from hence to you, cannot; neither can they paſſe to vs, that would come from thence.</hi> From Hell there is no redemption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas the Romiſh Church teacheth, and <note place="margin">2 All the faithfull and true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers are cleanſed from their ſinnes in this life.</note> holdeth, that they that are caſt into <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> are of the faithfull ſort, beleeuers; the Scripture prooueth that all the faithfull, all true beleeuers are waſhed and cleanſed from their ſinnes in this life, and are therefore bleſſed af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter this life: For S <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <note n="k" place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, cleanſeth vs from all ſinne. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> ſaith, <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>there is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Ieſus. Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith, <note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>He that heareth my word, and beleeueth on him that ſent me, hath euerlaſting life, and ſhall not come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: but is paſſed from death vnto life.</hi> And a voice from heauen ſaith vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi>

                  <hi>Write, bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their labours, and their workes doe follow them.</hi> Now, ſeeing that the ſtate of the faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, is ſuch, that they are cleanſed, and purified from their ſinnes in the bloud of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſeeing there is no condemnation to them that are in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſeeing they that beleeue in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhall not come into condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but paſſe from death to life; and ſeeing that all the faithfull are bleſſed when they die, and their workes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, that is, they haue the reward of their workes; then it is euident, that they goe not to any place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before they come to heauen; but vpon their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, they aſcend to heauen, and are with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3 The canonicall Scripture doth not mention prayer for the dead.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Canonicall Scripture doth not ſo much as mention Prayer for the dead; no, not in thoſe places where there is mention of <hi>ſacrifices</hi> and <hi>prayer;</hi> yea, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:21095:182"/> of the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>righteous:</hi> but rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> ſaith, <note n="o" place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>I would not haue you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe, that ye ſorrow not, euen as other, which haue no hope.</hi> Where, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> giueth vs to vnderſtand, that if our friends departed, were in any place of torment, if they were in paine and miſerie, then indeed, we had cauſe to ſorrow and mourne, to pray, and to doe any thing that might procure them eaſe; but ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I would not haue you to ſorrow as men without hope;</hi> as if he had ſaid, If you haue hope, that your friends departed are at reſt. haue eaſe, and ſhall riſe againe to glorie; why then doe you ſorrow for them as they that haue <hi>no hope,</hi> either of their preſent reſt, or future Reſurrection to glorie? you ſhould rather reioyce, for that they are at reſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, though it cannot be denied, but that <hi>Prayer</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4 Prayer for the dead, though it be auncient, yet is it neither Apoſtolicall; nor yet vſed by the moſt aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Fathers of the Church, as it is by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts at this day.</note> for the dead is an auncient cuſtome, long vſed in the Church: yet notwithſtanding, I ſay,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it commeth ſhort of that antiquitie, to be an <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> doctrine. For, before <note n="p" place="margin">Tertul. de coro. mil.</note> 
                  <hi>Turtullians</hi> time, there's little or no mention of Prayer for the dead: and he himſelfe acknowledgeth, that it hath no firme foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but onely from <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>cuſtome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the auncient Fathers did not vſe Prayer for the dead, as the Romiſh Church doth vſe it at this day: namely, for the eaſing of ſoules in <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them from thence; but for other ends, as hath bin ſufficiently declared before: And the auncient Fathers, (if they be rightly vnderſtood) doe nothing at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the doctrine of the preſent Romiſh Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their manner of praying for the dead.</p>
               <p>The conſideration hereof, ſerues <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, to reproue thoſe, who when they ſpeake of their <note place="margin">Againſt thoſe that pray for mercie to the ſoules of their friends depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> friend, departed, pray that God would haue mercie on their ſoules; for although, the Prayers of the auncient Church for the ſoules of the dead, might receiue ſome
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:21095:182"/> tollerable interpretation before <hi>Purgatory</hi> was beleeued; yet now, ſince that the Romiſh Church hath deuiſed a <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> and that it is held amongſt them as an article of faith; it is dangerous to make ſuch a Prayer. For this kinde of Prayer that God would haue <hi>mercy on his ſoule,</hi> howſoeuer it may demonſtrate the affection of him that prayeth for his friend departed; yet may it be offenſiue two wayes:</p>
               <p>Firſt, by taking Gods name in vaine, through a too frequent, and common vſing of it in ordinarie commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; as the manner of ſome is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by an opinion of ſuppoſing his friend to be in <hi>Purgatorie:</hi> for in praying for mercie to his ſoule, hee ſuppoſeth, (or at leaſt, breeds an opinion in the mindes of the hearers, that he doth ſuppoſe) that the ſoule of his friend departed, is in the paines of <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> and hath neede of mercie to be ſhewed to his ſoule: whereas it is certaine, that the faithfull departed out of this life, haue obtained mercie before they yeeld vp the Ghoſt, and they are purged &amp; cleanſed from their ſins in the bloud of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, hence we learne, that although it be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <label type="milestone">

               <p>Secondly, ſeeing that our materiall Churches are the <note place="margin">2 Againſt thoſe which profane the houſe of God by any diſorder.</note> places of Gods worſhip; this reprooues thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the houſe of God by any manner of diſorder.

               <p>Thirdly, here they are reprooued, who are backward <note place="margin">3 Againſt thoſe who will not willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the maintenance &amp; reparation of the Church.</note> and vnwilling to contribute to the neceſſarie mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and reparation of the materiall Church; <hi>Dauid,</hi> that holy man of God, did purpoſe (ſuch was his zeale) to build a houſe for the Lord; for he reaſoned thus: <note n="h" place="margin">

As vpon the Lords day, Parents and maſters of families, are bound not only to come to the houſe of God themſelues, but likewiſe to bring with them, their children and ſeruants to the publique wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: ſo likewiſe in the houſe; Parents and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of families are bound, morning and euening, and at all times of the day when they receiue their meate; to pray to God, and to praiſe God, either themſelues, if they haue knowledge, and abilitie to performe the ſame: or elſe, to ſee it performed by ſome other; and that through their default, praier and thankſgiuing be not omitted:</p>

               <p>Secondly, this dutie of worſhipping God, and doing <note place="margin">2 Parents and maſters of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſo char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</note> him ſeruice priuately in the houſe, is a dutie wherewith Parents and maſters of families are charged: <hi>Moſes,</hi> the the man of God, exhorting the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, directeth his ſpeech to the heades of the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the maſters of families, ſaying,</p>

               <p>The Second thing required in the framing of our <note place="margin">2 Attention in praying.</note> praiers aright, is Attention in praying. Before we pray, we muſt make preparation for prayer: and in praying, we muſt be carefull to pray with attention, to pray with the heart &amp; affection, leſt we be in the number of thoſe, who <note n="c" place="margin">

               <p>Firſt, in praying, wee muſt carefully attend to the words which we vtter; leſt, we erre in the matter of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſo may pray amiſſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, in praying our mind muſt be aboue, and <note place="margin">3 The heart muſt be fixed vpon God.</note> our heart ſo fixed vpon God, that it do not wander from God, through by-thoughts. Theſe three things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for our attention in praying.</p>

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities;</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, many are the afflictions, tribulations, and <note place="margin">3 Stirring vp the heart to pray with ſighs and groaning.</note> temptations of the godly; they haue many perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſo trouble and diſtemper them of times, that they finde a marueilous vnfitneſſe to pray; and if they ſet themſelues to pray, cannot pray as they would; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the Spirit helpeth our infirmities; in this caſe, the <hi>ſpirit it ſelfe maketh interceſſion for vs with groanings, which cannot be vttered:</hi> that is, the Spirit doth ſtirre vp in the ſoule deuoutly affected, holy ſighes, and ſpirituall groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings which crie alowd in the eares of the Lord.</p>

               </list>
               <p>To the firſt: In the right manner of obſeruing a <hi>Faſt,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 The right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a true faſt. To which foure things are required.</note> that it may pleaſe God; there are foure things required.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when we faſt, either publiquely, or priuately, it is required, that we abſtaine from all meate and drinke, ſo long as the <hi>faſt</hi> is continued. The greeke word which ſignifieth to <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>when all the people came to cauſe Dauid to eate meat while it was yet day, Dauid ſware, ſaying, So doe God to me, and more alſo, if I taſte bread or ought elſe, till the Sunne be downe.</hi> Notwithſtanding, herein there muſt be a reſpect had of the conſtitution of the bodie; how the bodie is able to continue, and hold out the ſet time of the faſt, without fainting: whtrefore one ſaith, <note n="d" place="margin">Dometur caro, non interimatur.</note> 
                  <hi>let the fleſh be tamed, not deſtroyed.</hi> For God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that we ſhould deſtroy the fleſh, and hurt the body with faſting, but onely, that we tame the fleſh, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the body.</p>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:21095:215"/>
               <p> Secondly, in faſting, we muſt abſtaine not onely from <note place="margin">2 To abſtaine from all ſinne.</note> all meat, but likewiſe from all ſinne: for want of which abſtinence from ſin, the Lord diſlikes of the abſtinence from meat; the people ſay, <note n="c" place="margin">

                  <hi>wherefore haue we faſted, and thou ſeeſt not?

                  <hi>It is not the bare abſtaining from meates that makes the good faſt, but abſtaining from ſinnes, as well as from meats.</hi> Not onely the ſtomacke ſhould faſt from meats, but all the members of the bodie ſhould faſt from ſinne; the heart ſhould faſt from hatred and malice, and enuie: the tongue ſhould faſt from blaſphemous words, from ſlanderous ſpeeches, and from all corrupt and filthie communication: the eyes ſhould faſt from beholding vanitie: the eares ſhould faſt from receiuing tales: the hands ſhould faſt from working wickedneſſe: and the feete ſhould faſt from walking the pathes of vnrighteouſneſſe. When we faſt, we ſhould not taſte of the bread of malice, that's ſowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened bread: nor touch the daintie meat of carnall pleaſure, that's a ſurfetting meat: but we ought to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from euill thoughts, ſinfull words, and wicked deeds; for theſe are all vncleane meat, and defile a man, as ſaith our Sauiour; <note n="g" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the day of our faſt, we ought to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">3 To be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in doing of good. Two-fold.</note> in doing of good: doing workes of</p>

               <p>Secondly, vpon the day of our faſt, we ought to doe workes of Charitie: to feed the hungrie, to cloath the <note place="margin">2 To do workes of charitie.</note> naked, to reliue the oppreſſed, &amp;c. <note n="i" place="margin">

                  <hi>Is not this the faſt that I haue choſon,</hi> ſaith the Lord; <hi>to looſe the bands of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, to vndoe the heauie burdens, and to let the oppreſſed goe free, and that ye breake euery yoake?

When thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him, and that thou hide not thy ſelfe from thine owne fleſh?</hi> That is a good faſt, when as to our faſting, we ioyne mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and charitie. No man ſhould faſt out of a couetous minde, to ſpare the more, but ſo much as he ſpareth by faſting, he ſhould giue to the poore.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if our faſt be a priuate faſt, we muſt faſt in <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4 To faſt in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</note> and not like the <hi>Phariſies,</hi> deſire to be ſeene, and knowne of men that we faſt: It is ſufficient that our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting be knowne vnto God: of this, our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, <note n="k" place="margin">

               <p>The ſecond thing in faſting, is, the right vſe, and end <note place="margin">2 The right end of faſting. Twofold.</note> of faſting: The ends whereunto faſting ſerueth, are two:</p>

                  <hi>I humbled my ſoule with faſting.</hi> When the Lord humbleth vs with any croſſe, and affliction, we ſhould then humble our ſoules vnder the hand of God, by faſting, &amp; weeping, and mourning; as ſaith the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi>
