            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Secondly, in true faith, there is required an aÅ¿Å¿ent vnto <note place="margin">2 An aÅ¿Å¿ent vnto the Word of God.</note> the Word of God; that is, to euery word of God in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: and in particular, to the promiÅ¿es of the GoÅ¿pell, made to them that beleeue: becauÅ¿e it is Å¿ayd; <note n="h" place="margin">

                  <hi>They profeÅ¿Å¿e that they know God, but in workes they deny him, being abominable and diÅ¿obedient, and vnto euery good worke reprobate.</hi> Heere is mention of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying God; but who deny him? they that profeÅ¿Å¿e they know God. How may that bee, that they which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e God, Å¿hould alÅ¿o deny God? they profeÅ¿Å¿e him in words, but deny him in deedes. Such AtheiÅ¿ts as theÅ¿e, there were in the ApoÅ¿tles time, I would there were not cauÅ¿e to complaine of Å¿uch in our time. Many, yea, the moÅ¿t men profeÅ¿Å¿e that they know God; they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there is a God, and they acknowledge that God is to be worÅ¿hipped; yet many deny God by their workes. ConÅ¿ider this firÅ¿t in prophane people: Demand of the greateÅ¿t Swearer, Prophaner of the Saboth, Quarreller, Adulterer, Drunkard, &amp;c. whether he know God. Hee will profeÅ¿Å¿e that he knowes God: but look to his deeds, and you Å¿hall finde that they are vile and abominable: his workes are Å¿uch, and his manner of life Å¿uch, as if he rather thought in his heart there were no God: neither
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21095:43"/> God nor Deuill, neither Heauen nor Hell. Secondly, conÅ¿ider this in Hypocrites; they profeÅ¿Å¿e that they know God, they worÅ¿hip God publikely, and it may be priuately too; in the Church, and in the houÅ¿e; they read the Scriptures, heare the Word, and receiue the Sacraments: in a word, they will not be behinde in any outward religious duty of piety and holineÅ¿Å¿e. And all this is godly and religious. What then is wanting? one thing is wanting; the practice of godlineÅ¿Å¿e: a good life, a godly conuerÅ¿ation anÅ¿werable to their profeÅ¿Å¿ion: this is wanting. For conÅ¿ider, in regard of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the duties of piety; how Å¿ome doe all in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Å¿hew, and for vaine-glory: pray and faÅ¿t, to be Å¿een of men: and giue almes, to haue praiÅ¿e of men: conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their workes of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, their dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, how farre they are from doing vnto others, as they would that men Å¿hould do vnto them: further, let it be obÅ¿erued, how diuerÅ¿e will take their times and opportunities, when they are out of the company of the godly, they be for all companies; to doe as others doe: to Å¿weare among Swearers, to game with GameÅ¿ters, to drinke with Drunkards, to bee partakers with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, and as the Å¿aying is, among Good-fellowes to play the Good-fellow; to carowÅ¿e and drinke healths, &amp;c. and by theÅ¿e things it may euidently appeare, that though they profeÅ¿Å¿e they know God, yet by their works they deny him. TheÅ¿e are no good ChriÅ¿tians, no Å¿ound ProfeÅ¿Å¿ours; becauÅ¿e their words and their workes doe not agree together: their conuerÅ¿ation is not anÅ¿werable to their profeÅ¿Å¿ion: but theÅ¿e are Hypocrites, yea, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiÅ¿ts; denying God: <hi>They profeÅ¿Å¿e that they know God, but in workes they deny him.</hi>

               <p>To conclude, Å¿eeing that wicked life, and a bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿ation rankes a man, either amongÅ¿t the prophane, or amongÅ¿t Hypocrites, and Å¿uch as deny God: my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to all that know God aright, and to thoÅ¿e that make a good profeÅ¿Å¿ion, is, that of the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul</hi> to

               <p>The Å¿econd kinde of Idolatry, is Internall &amp; Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: <note place="margin">2 Inward, or Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Idolatry.</note> &amp; that is, Idolatry of the heart. This Idolatry is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, when we loue any thing aboue God, or truÅ¿t in any thing more then in God, and Å¿o Å¿et vp an Idoll in our hearts. This Idolatry is more generall then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; this reacheth to all Å¿orts of people: for though a man doe know the true God, acknowledge one God in three perÅ¿ons, worÅ¿hip the true God, and abhorre Idols; though he make no Image of God, neither bow downe before any Image; in a word, thogh a man be no Infidel, no Heathen-man, but a ChriÅ¿tian; no PapiÅ¿t, but a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tant; yet for all this, hee may be an Idolater in heart: by Å¿eetting his heart vpon Å¿ome thing that hee loues, more then vpon God; and by putting his truÅ¿t and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Å¿ome thing elÅ¿e more then in God. Thus the couetous man makes an Idoll of his riches and wealth, of his Å¿iluer and gold. <hi>Iob</hi> Å¿aith, <note n="u" place="margin">

                  <hi>There are diuerÅ¿e Å¿orts of Idolatry. One hath Mammon for his Lord; another makes his belly his God; another makes Å¿ome other luÅ¿t his God: and though thou doeÅ¿t not offer Å¿acrifice vnto theÅ¿e thy Gods, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did, yet thou doeÅ¿t worÅ¿e, for thou Å¿acrificeÅ¿t thine owne Å¿oule vnto them: thou boweÅ¿t not the knee to them, neither doeÅ¿t fall downe before theÅ¿e thy gods, to worÅ¿hip them; but yet thou art obedient vnto them, and art at their command: if thy belly or thy luÅ¿ts command thy Å¿eruice, and require to doe any thing for them, thou art ready to doe it.</hi> Thus <hi>ChryÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome.</hi> Now, it Å¿tands vs ChriÅ¿tians in hand, as wee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor Idols, for the outward; Å¿o to looke to our hearts and affections, that wee doe not Å¿et vp an Idoll in our heart: for certaine it is, we cannot both worÅ¿hip God, and Å¿erue Idols, whether outward or inward. <note n="b" place="margin">

If a ChriÅ¿tian doe truely Å¿erue and worÅ¿hip the true God, with the affection of the heart; if he loue God aboue all, truÅ¿t in God alone, and feare God with all his heart; then there will bee no roome to Å¿et vp the Idoll of CouetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, or PleaÅ¿ure, or LuÅ¿t, in the heart: theÅ¿e cannot agree together.</p>

                  <hi>God will haue all men to be Å¿aued, and come vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God, who hath appointed the end, hath alÅ¿o ordained meanes to the end: the end is the Å¿aluation of our Å¿oules: that's the end of our Faith, that's the bleÅ¿Å¿ed end that we deÅ¿ire, and long for; now the meanes of obtaining Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, is to come to the knowledge of the truth: to know and acknowledge the onely true God, and <hi>IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t</hi> whom hee hath Å¿ent. So neceÅ¿Å¿ary is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</p>
               <p>For the Second; how profitable the knowledge of <note place="margin">2 The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is profitable. For</note> God is, appeareth by the benefits that come thereby. Which are Å¿pecially theÅ¿e two.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, the true knowledge of God worketh peace and concord amongÅ¿t men of contrary diÅ¿poÅ¿itions; and <note place="margin">1 It maketh peace amongÅ¿t men of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diÅ¿poÅ¿itions.</note> correcteth the froward natures of men; making them, of fierce and wrathfull, to become gentle and patient. This was fore-Å¿hewed by the Prophet <hi>EÅ¿ay,</hi> Å¿aying. <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 11. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>The Wolfe Å¿hall dwell with the Lambe, the Leopard Å¿hall lie downe with the Kid: and the Calfe, and the young Lyon, and the Fatling together, and a little childe Å¿hall lead them. And the Cow and the Beare Å¿hall feed, &amp;c. They Å¿hall not hurt nor deÅ¿troy in all my holy mountaine: for the earth Å¿hall bee full of the knowledge of the LORD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where the knowledge of God is, it will work a great alteration and change: if by nature men be like Wolues, giuen to deuoure and deÅ¿troy their neighbours; the the knowledge of God will cauÅ¿e them to ceaÅ¿e from their rauinous, greedy deuouring of others: if they bee
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21095:48"/> by nature like Lyons and Beares, fierce, wrathfull, blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-minded; the true knowledge of God will tame them, and make them meeke and gentle.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if any now in the time of the GoÅ¿pell, be like Wolues, and Lyons, and Beares, towards their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and neighbours; it is, becauÅ¿e they haue not the true knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>But heere it will be Å¿ayd, that Å¿ome that haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> are wrathfull, cruell, and hard-hearted towards their brethren.</p>
               <p>I anÅ¿wer; their knowledge is not Å¿anctified: they haue <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">AnÅ¿w. </seg>
                  </label> knowledge, but not grace to put their knowledge in practice: they know God, but will not doe the will of God. They haue the knowledge of God in their heads, but not in their hearts. For certaine it is, if men had the true knowledge of God, aÅ¿well in their hearts and mindes, as in their heads and tongues; they would not, they durÅ¿t not be to their brethren, as Wolues, and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Beares; the knowledge of the Lord would make them more peaceable, more quiet, and patient.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the true knowledge of God brings eternall <note place="margin">2 Eternall life commeth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</note> life: Å¿o Å¿aith our Sauiour, <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>This is life eternall, to know thee the onely true God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing concerning the knowledge of God, is, the hurt and danger that comes through the want <note place="margin">3 The want of the knowledge of God, is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: for it cauÅ¿eth,</note> thereof. As the knowledge of God is neceÅ¿Å¿ary and profitable, Å¿o the want therof is hurtfull and dangerous.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e the want of the knowledge of God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth mourning and languiÅ¿hing, deÅ¿olation and deÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: as the Lord Å¿heweth in <hi>HoÅ¿ea,</hi> complaining that there was <note n="p" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, where the knowledge of God is not, men are giuen ouer to a reprobate minde, to doe things that <note place="margin">2 A reprobte minde.</note> are not conuenient. This <hi>S. Paul</hi> Å¿heweth, Å¿peaking of the <hi>Gentils,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to them that know not God, there remaines <note place="margin">3 PuniÅ¿hment.</note> nothing but iudgement, puniÅ¿hment, and euerlaÅ¿ting deÅ¿truction; as Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, <note n="Å¿" place="margin">2 <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9.</note>

               <p>Thirdly, without faith, we cannot be Å¿aued.

               <p>FirÅ¿t, by reading the word: the diligent reading of the Scriptures, is neceÅ¿Å¿arie for them that doe beleeue, to <note place="margin">1 Reading the Scriptures.</note> the increaÅ¿ing and preÅ¿eruing of their faith.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by hearing the word of God: for, as the <note place="margin">2 Hearing the word of God.</note> hearing of the word of God, is an effectuall meanes to beget faith, Å¿o is it alÅ¿o a powerfull meanes to nouriÅ¿h, Å¿trengthen, and preÅ¿erue faith.

For this cauÅ¿e, the word of God is Å¿aid to be the meate of the Å¿oule: it is both milke for young babes, and Å¿trong meate for Å¿trong men. They that are but young children in religion, babes in grace, may Å¿uck milke out of Gods word, to nouriÅ¿h their Å¿oules, &amp; they that are Å¿trong in faith, and growen in grace, may from the word of God, receiue Å¿trong meat to Å¿trengthen them more.

               <p> Thirdly, by deuine meditation. It is noted to be a property of a godly man, to meditate on the word of <note place="margin">Diuine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> God. <note n="g" place="margin">

               <p>Fourthly, by Godly conference: the two diÅ¿ciples, to <note place="margin">4 Godly confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> whom <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> appeared after his reÅ¿urrection, and talked with them, Å¿aid one to another, <note n="i" place="margin">

                  <hi>did not our heart burne within vs, while he talked with vs by the way, and while he opened to vs the Scriptures?</hi> the Å¿pirituall communication, and heauenly conference which <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> had with the DiÅ¿ciples, did heate them inwardly, and made their hearts burne within them: godly conference, Å¿pirituall Å¿peech, and heauenly communication doth inflame the heart, with the loue of God, doth Å¿tirre vp the affections, and kindle good deÅ¿ires: yea, increaÅ¿eth knowledge, and Å¿trengthneth faith: thus the Word of God, which begetteth faith, doth alÅ¿o increaÅ¿e, nouriÅ¿h, and preÅ¿erue the Å¿ame.</p>
               <p>The Å¿econd meanes of increaÅ¿ing faith, is the vÅ¿e, and <note place="margin">2 VÅ¿e of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> partaking of the Sacraments. For,</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Sacraments are a meanes of increaÅ¿ing <note place="margin">2 Confirming the promiÅ¿es of the GoÅ¿pell.</note> and Å¿trengthening our faith; for they confirme the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es made vnto vs in the GoÅ¿pell; for which cauÅ¿e, they are called Seales; for like as a man, making a grant to another in writing, of houÅ¿e, or lands; for the better confirmation and Å¿trenthening of the deede, he puts to his Å¿eale; Å¿o the Lord our God, to his gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull promiÅ¿es, made vnto vs in his written Word, hath annexed the Sacraments, as Å¿eales, to aÅ¿Å¿ure vs of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his promiÅ¿es.

Hence it is, that a ChriÅ¿tian findes in himÅ¿elfe, pride of heart, luÅ¿t of the fleÅ¿h, filthy deÅ¿ires, vncleane thoughts, couetous deÅ¿ires, anger, hatred, enuy, malice, grudgings, and deÅ¿ire of reuenge, &amp;c. haling and pulling him one way; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t theÅ¿e, he feeles humility, temperance, loue, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, meekneÅ¿Å¿e, and other graces, drawing him another

                  <hi>Examine your Å¿elues whether yee be in the faith, prooue your owne Å¿elues: know ye not your owne Å¿elues, how that IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is in you, except you be reprobates?</hi> Now then let vs euery one make a Å¿earch into our hearts, and try whether wee finde the good Spirit of God perÅ¿wading vs indeede, that wee are the children of God, and that wee haue faith: whether we haue a feeling of Å¿pirituall grace: whether the Spirit of God hath wrought in vs a loue of God, a hatred of Å¿inne, a reÅ¿olued purpoÅ¿e to amend our liues: whether we finde in our Å¿elues, the Å¿pirit of grace and of Å¿upplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and whether we can truely finde that inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betweene the fleÅ¿h and the Å¿pirit. If theÅ¿e things be in vs, happy are we. But if vpon examination had, theÅ¿e things be wanting in any, Å¿uch men may Å¿peake of faith, but as yet they haue it not: they are farre Å¿hort of true
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21095:77"/> Å¿auing faith, and Å¿o come Å¿hort of Å¿aluation. Let the Å¿earch be made a little more inwardly: A man may know whether hee hath faith, by the inward feeling of grace; if faith be in the heart, the Spirit of God will Å¿et it a working, it will not lie aÅ¿leep, but it will Å¿tirre vp other graces of God in vs; it will make vs to loue God, and hate Å¿inne, more then euer we did before. It will moue vs to pray, and call vpon the name of the Lord. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if any one doe not feele in himÅ¿elfe, a gracious working of the good Spirit, if he finde not in himÅ¿elfe a farre greater loue of God, and loathing of Å¿inne, if hee haue not a more holy purpoÅ¿e to obey God, &amp; to do his will; if he doe not, nor cannot pray, if in his trouble and affliction, outward and inward, hee doe not Å¿eeke vnto God, if he doe not with the childe, run to his Heauenly Father, and cry, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> it's an euident Å¿igne, that as yet, <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> doth not dwell in his heart by faith, &amp; that as yet he liues not by the faith of the Sonne of God. Let vs Å¿earch yet a little further; the vnregenerate man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in Å¿inne, liues in the manifeÅ¿t tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion of the Commandements of God, yet preÅ¿umes hee hath faith. I hope, Å¿aith hee, I haue a good faith: but how is it, Ã´ man, if thou haÅ¿t true faith, that thou Å¿till liueÅ¿t in Å¿inne? certaine it is, if faith were in thy heart, it would cauÅ¿e a reformation of life, or at leaÅ¿t, a holy purpoÅ¿e of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life. And Å¿o in time, and by degrees, thy heart would be renewed, and thy life reformed.</p>
               <p>Indeede, I know I ought to reforme my wayes, and amend my life, and I would faine amend, but it is the fleÅ¿h that drawes mee to euill. But I demand of thee, Ã´ man that complaineÅ¿t of the fleÅ¿h, where is the inward conflict betweene the fleÅ¿h and the Å¿pirit? and where is thy Å¿triuing againÅ¿t thy corruptions? what, doe euill thoughts ariÅ¿e in thy heart, and thou makeÅ¿t no reÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance? doth thy heart Å¿well with pride? doe filthy luÅ¿ts ariÅ¿e in thy heart? doth thy heart abound with couetous deÅ¿ire? and ouerflow with the gall of bitterneÅ¿Å¿e, anger,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21095:78"/> hatred, enuy, malice, and deÅ¿ire of reuenge? and doeÅ¿t thou not Å¿triue againÅ¿t theÅ¿e corruptions, but giueÅ¿t way vnto them, entertaining them, and embracing them? certainely, heere is no good Å¿igne of grace, nor of true faith. For where true faith is, there will be a reÅ¿iÅ¿ting of Å¿inne, and a Å¿triuing againÅ¿t corruptions. Wherefore, if we would haue a good teÅ¿timony in our Å¿elues, of the aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urance of true faith, then wee muÅ¿t bee carefull to reÅ¿iÅ¿t Å¿inne, and to Å¿triue againÅ¿t our corruptions: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the combate will be great, to maÅ¿ter our Å¿innes, and to get dominion ouer our corruptions, yet by little and little, we Å¿hall ouercome, and in the end, get the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.

                  <hi>Å¿uffering that made them Martyrs, but their cauÅ¿e.</hi> BecauÅ¿e they Å¿uffered for the name of ChriÅ¿t. Wherefore, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, though they Å¿uffer neuer Å¿o manie, and Å¿ore tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet they are not Martyrs, neither are their Å¿uffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings acceptable to God: becauÅ¿e they Å¿uffer not for ChriÅ¿t's Å¿ake: nor for the truth, but againÅ¿t the truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Å¿ufferings are acceptable to God, when they <note place="margin">2 To Å¿uffer for well-doing.</note> are for well-doing: and when we are afflicted, perfecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and troubled wrongfully. As <hi>S. Peter</hi> Å¿aith, <note n="g" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>This is thanke-worthy, if a man for conÅ¿cience toward God endure griefe, Å¿uffering wrongfully.</hi> Againe, he Å¿aith, <note n="h" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>it is better if the will of God be Å¿o, that ye Å¿uffer for well-doing, then for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill doing.</hi> And againe, <note n="i" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 15. 16</note> 
                  <hi>let none of you Å¿uffer as a murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or as a theefe, or as an euill doer, or as a buÅ¿ibodie in other mens matters, yet if any man Å¿uffer as a ChriÅ¿tian, let him not be aÅ¿hamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing, which makes our Å¿ufferings accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, is to Å¿uffer patiently. Whether it be for <note place="margin">3 To Å¿uffer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently.</note> ChriÅ¿t's Å¿ake, or whether it be in any other righteous cauÅ¿e, it is the part of a ChriÅ¿tian, not onely to Å¿uffer, but to Å¿uffer patiently. For this is the difference betweene the wicked and the godly, concerning their Å¿ufferings: both may Å¿uffer afflictions, as Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, infirmitie, and paine of bodie, pouertie, and Å¿uch like, but not both alike: both may Å¿uffer the Å¿ame things, but not with the Å¿ame mind. The wicked Å¿uffer afflictions of neceÅ¿Å¿itie, becauÅ¿e they cannot helpe themÅ¿elues, and know not how to be ridd of their paine, and troubles; their Å¿uffering is a conÅ¿trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Å¿uffering, and their patience, patience perforce. But the godly Å¿uffer afflictions patiently: they endure all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which the Lord layes vpon them, with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde, a meeke heart, and quiet patience. Such ought our Å¿ufferings to be, that they may pleaÅ¿e God.</p>

For, I was an hungred, and yee gaue me no meat: I was thirÅ¿tie, and ye gaue me no drinke: I was a Å¿tranger, and ye tooke me not in: naked, and ye cloathed me not: Å¿icke, and in priÅ¿on, and ye viÅ¿itted me not.</hi> So that not onely the committing of great Å¿innes, of vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t our brethren, as taking away from them, by violence, or any manner of wrong-dealing, their lands, liuings, houÅ¿es, fields; or oppreÅ¿Å¿ing them with heauie burdens, &amp;c. but the verie omitting of the neceÅ¿Å¿arie duties of charitie, not giuing part of that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which God hath giuen vs, to the relieuing of the poore; the verie Å¿topping of our eares at the cry of the poore: the cloÅ¿ing of out hands againÅ¿t the poore, and the Å¿hutting vp of the bowels of compaÅ¿Å¿ion from them that are in miÅ¿erie, and diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e, is able to caÅ¿t Å¿oule and bodie into hell.</p>

In theÅ¿e daies we may Å¿ee many great, and faire houÅ¿es, but in few of

               <p>TheÅ¿e are the true cauÅ¿es of the decay, and preÅ¿ent want of HoÅ¿pitalitie.

Nay, you ought not to faint, nor be diÅ¿coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in the profeÅ¿Å¿ion of godlineÅ¿Å¿e, nor yet to be afraid to confeÅ¿Å¿e ChriÅ¿t before men, though you Å¿uffer for the name of ChriÅ¿t; for this is the portion of the righteous in this life, to be afflicted, perÅ¿ecuted, and troubled; and concerning this, I Å¿ay with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man Å¿uffer as a ChriÅ¿tian, let him not be aÅ¿hamed, but let him glorifie God on this behalfe.</hi> A Å¿eruant that attends vpon a great man of place, is not aÅ¿hamed to weare his cogniÅ¿ance, and to be knowne to belong vnto him, but eÅ¿teemes it his credite, and accounts it his honour, to be knowne, and noted, that he is Å¿eruant to Å¿uch a worthie Gentleman, or that he belongs to Å¿uch an honorable perÅ¿on: Å¿o euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian ought much more to reioyce; and glory in this, that he is the Å¿eruant of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. Now, that which makes a ChriÅ¿tian knowne to bee the Å¿eruant of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, is, not to be aÅ¿hamed of the GoÅ¿pell of ChriÅ¿t, it is his conÅ¿tant confeÅ¿Å¿ion of ChriÅ¿t, and the open, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿t profeÅ¿Å¿ion of his Faith and Religion before men, ioyning thereunto a godly life, hauing his conuerÅ¿ation as it becommeth the GoÅ¿pell of ChriÅ¿t.</p>

               <p> And a ChriÅ¿tian ought to be Å¿o farre from being aÅ¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the profeÅ¿Å¿ion of the GoÅ¿pell, that he ought to glorie therein, and count it his greateÅ¿t honour, that he is Å¿eruant to Å¿o great a Lord, as the Lord IeÅ¿us. <note place="margin">2 AgainÅ¿t thoÅ¿e who are Å¿till doubtfull, and not Å¿etled in iudgement for the truth of Religion.</note>

To Å¿uch, I may Å¿ay, as <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet Å¿aid to the Å¿educed <hi>IÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> in the dayes of King <hi>Ahab;</hi>

                  <hi>How long halt yee betweene two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him:</hi> How long halt ye betweene two religions of ProteÅ¿tants and PapiÅ¿t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>? If the Lord be God, follow him, and worÅ¿hip him in Å¿pirit and truth, as hee hath commaunded: but if <hi>Baal</hi> be God, if to worÅ¿hip Saints, and to bow downe before Images, be the true worÅ¿hip of God; then follow them. For if a man haue faith, its neceÅ¿Å¿arie, that he alÅ¿o confeÅ¿Å¿e the truth of his faith, with his mouth, and profeÅ¿Å¿e the Å¿ame in his life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Å¿eeing that a ChriÅ¿tian is to giue teÅ¿timonie of his faith by outward profeÅ¿Å¿ion, then what faith hath <note place="margin">3 AgainÅ¿t luke-warme profeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ours.</note> the luke-warme ChriÅ¿tian, which is neither hote nor cold?

Such luke-warme profeÅ¿Å¿ours, are abhominable in the Å¿ight of God, and euen loathed of him.

               </head>
               <p>REpentance is a gift of God, whereby a Å¿inner, <note place="margin">1 What Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is.</note> through the feare of God, is changed in his minde, and turned from Å¿inne vnto God.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, I Å¿ay, that Repentance is a gift of God: <note place="margin">1 A gift of God.</note> for Å¿o the Scripture makes it. For in the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles, it is Å¿ayd, <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>God hath alÅ¿o to the Gentiles granted Repentance vnto life.</hi> And to <hi>Timothy, S. Paul</hi> Å¿aith, <note n="b" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>If God peraduenture will giue them repentance to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the truth.</hi> Heere, by Gods <hi>granting and giuing</hi> repentance, it is apparent, that Repentance is the gift of God.</p>
               <p>Next, in the definition of Repentance, there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <note place="margin">2 The feare of God. In the firÅ¿t conuerÅ¿ion of a Å¿inner, diuers things concur.</note> the <hi>feare of God,</hi> moouing the Å¿inner to repent. In the act of Repentance, euen in the firÅ¿t conuerÅ¿ion of a Å¿inner, there are diuerÅ¿e things concurre.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, there is the gracious working of God, who, by his holy Spirit doth Å¿often the heart of a Å¿inner, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him grace to conuert, and to turne from Å¿inne vnto <note place="margin">1 Gods holy Spirit, by which God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Å¿inner grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</note> God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is the working of that feare, which is called the <hi>Å¿eruile feare;</hi> whereby, a Å¿inner is mooued and Å¿tirred, is vexed and diÅ¿quieted in himÅ¿elfe, for feare of puniÅ¿hment; and is euen terrefied and affrighted with the hideous Å¿ight of his abominable Å¿innes, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <note place="margin">2 Seruile feare.</note> of Gods iudgement for Å¿inne. when he Å¿eeth Hell gaping to deuoure him: which horrible feare, though in the wicked and reprobate, it be a torment, and able to bring them to deÅ¿paration; as it was in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Iudas:</hi> yet in the children of God, this legall terror and affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Å¿inners with the feare of puniÅ¿hment, may bee a preparation to receiue grace; when as they are truely humbled for their Å¿innes, vnder the Å¿ence and feeling of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21095:106"/> Gods anger and diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure againÅ¿t Å¿inne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the working of Faith; whereby the Å¿inner <note place="margin">3 Faith.</note> beginnes to looke vnto ChriÅ¿t, and beleeues the remiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of his Å¿innes, at the leaÅ¿t, beleeues that his Å¿innes are pardonable.</p>

But a Å¿inner that continueth <note place="margin">Continuance in Å¿inne is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: for</note> Å¿till in his Å¿innes, and goeth on in an vngodly courÅ¿e of life, knoweth not into what a dangerous Å¿tate he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his Å¿oule; for</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, by continuing in Å¿inne, hee clogges his conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">1 It ouer-burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Å¿oule with Å¿inne.</note> and preÅ¿Å¿eth his Å¿oule with an intollerable burden of Å¿inne: the wiÅ¿eman Å¿aith, <note n="m" place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, by continuing in Å¿inne, the Å¿oule growes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> worÅ¿e: for by a continuall committing of Å¿inne, there is a continuall decaying of grace, and the harder will it be to repaire againe the Å¿pirituall Å¿tate of the Å¿oule.

Such is the Å¿tate of the Å¿oule; the longer that a Å¿inner continueth in Å¿inne and wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, the greater are the breaches which Å¿inne maketh in the Å¿oule, and the harder will it be to repaire them: and the longer that a Å¿inner Å¿uffereth the Å¿ores of his Å¿oule to feÅ¿ter and corrupt, the more hardly Å¿hall he be cured.</p>

               <p>The Å¿econd, is the word of God; whereby we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten <note place="margin">2 The word of God.</note> to a new life. Of which S. <hi>Iames</hi> faith, <note n="b" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The Å¿econd thing concerning amendment of life, is, <note place="margin">2 After what manner amend ment of life is wrought in a Å¿inner.</note> How, and after what manner this bleÅ¿Å¿ed change of life is wrought in a Å¿inner. Reformation or amendment of life is wrought thus:</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, before amendment of life, there muÅ¿t goe an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained forÅ¿aking of our former euill conuerÅ¿ation: wee <note place="margin">1 There muÅ¿t be an vtter forÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our old euill conuerÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> muÅ¿t firÅ¿t die to Å¿inne, before we can be quickened to a new life: we muÅ¿t firÅ¿t ceaÅ¿e from dead workes, before we can doe good workes.

                  <hi>Before we can put on the new man, we muÅ¿t firÅ¿t put off the old man.</hi> We muÅ¿t firÅ¿t put off the raggs of Å¿inne, before we can put on the robe of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e. This muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily firÅ¿t be, before we can be renewed and reformed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, amendment of life is wrought in the whole <note place="margin">2 It muÅ¿t be in the whole man.</note> man: in Å¿oule, and in bodie: in the minde, in the will, and affections; in the cogitations and thoughts of the heart; in the eye, in the eare, in the tongue, and in the hands; in life and conuerÅ¿ation. As the mind muÅ¿t be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, Å¿o the life muÅ¿t be reformed.</p>

But this reformation and amendment of life was firÅ¿t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne within: <hi>A new heart will I giue you, and a new Å¿pirit will I put within you,</hi> Å¿aith the Lord, to the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ies, thoÅ¿e hypocrites, which outwardly did appeare righteous vnto men, but within were full of hypocriÅ¿ie, and iniquities our Sauiour Å¿aith, <note n="f" place="margin">

               <p>HOpe of long life, is the fourth impediment of <note place="margin">4 Hope of long life.</note> Repentance: This hope hinders many men from repentance; but this their hope is a vaine hope; and men build this their vaine hope vpon a very weake and deceaueable foundation: Some vpon their yong age; Å¿ome, vpon the Å¿trength of their body; and others, vpon the pure and good complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: One reaÅ¿ons thus, I neede not repent yet, I am but young, I am in my youthfull dayes, in the prime of my age, in my flouriÅ¿hing yeares, I hope to liue yet many yeares; I Å¿hall haue time enough to repent hereafter; it will be time enough for mee to repent when olde age commeth. Another thus, I feele my body to be Å¿trong and luÅ¿ty; I am healthfull, I haue no paine, nor ake, I feele no infirmity, neither am I troubled with any diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿e; I Å¿hall liue long, I neede not repent yet; it will be time enough for me to repent when my Å¿trength faileth, when I feele my Å¿elfe grow weake, and when Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e commeth vpon me. Another thus, I am of a pure and good complection, of a ruddie countenance, death will not come neere me, I may take my pleaÅ¿ure yet a long time: And as for repentance, when I beginne to waxe pale and wanne, and when I perceiue wrinkles to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in my face, then I will repent. Thus fooliÅ¿h are we, to put off our repentance till olde age, till the day of death, and till the laÅ¿t houre. But grant, that God Å¿uffer the Å¿inner to liue in his vngodly courÅ¿e of life, euen till he be olde, yet he will hope Å¿till to liue a little longer; there's no man Å¿o olde, but thinkes he may liue yet one yeare longer: So vainely doe men pleaÅ¿e themÅ¿elues with the hope of long life: And this hope of long life

               <p>For the firÅ¿t; <note n="a" place="margin">Bellarm. de Purgator.</note> Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> giueth vs a cleare <note place="margin">1 How the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent RomiÅ¿h Church hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth Prayer for the dead.</note> light to know how, &amp; in what Å¿ence, the preÅ¿ent RomiÅ¿h Church holdeth and maintaineth Prayer for the dead: for he tells vs that there are three places of receptacle, <hi>Heauen, Hell,</hi> and <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> (beÅ¿ides his faigned <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus)</hi> for three Å¿orts of people departing hence, that is to Å¿ay the iuÅ¿t and righteous ones: the wicked and vngod ly; and they that are of a middle Å¿ort, beleeuers; but yet Å¿uch as are not throughly cleanÅ¿ed from their Å¿innes. As for the iuÅ¿t and righteous, he doubts not but their Å¿oules goe Å¿traight to ParadiÅ¿e, to Heauen; as the Å¿oules of the ApoÅ¿tles, Martyrs, &amp;c. As for the wicked and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:21095:180"/> vngodly, impenitent Å¿inners, and Infidels<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> hee maketh no queÅ¿tion of them, but that they goe downe to Hell, neuer to be deliuered. All the queÅ¿tion is, of the third Å¿ort; thoÅ¿e of the middle Å¿ort, which are <hi>neither very good, nor very euill;</hi> but Å¿uch as die in their veniall Å¿innes, or haue not Å¿atisfied for the temporall puniÅ¿hment of their mortall Å¿innes; and therefore Å¿uch muÅ¿t be caÅ¿t into the fire of <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> to purge them more from their Å¿ins, and as it were to Å¿coure away their droÅ¿Å¿e, till they haue Å¿atisfied the iuÅ¿tice of God, partly by their owne Å¿uffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; and partly by the prayers, faÅ¿tings, almeÅ¿deeds of others, and Å¿uch like. This is the Faith of the preÅ¿ent Romane Church concerning Prayer for the dead: Å¿o that the praiers of the RomiÅ¿ts which they make for the dead, are chiefely intended for the Å¿oules of their friends in <hi>Purgatorie;</hi> that thereby they may procure Å¿ome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of their paines, and bring (as they imagine) Å¿ome eaÅ¿e to their tormented Å¿oules.</p>
               <p>The Å¿econd thing concerning Prayer for the dead, is, <note place="margin">2 In what Å¿ence the auncient Fathers haue mentioned, &amp; Å¿ometimes vÅ¿ed prayer for the dead.</note> to Å¿hew in what Å¿ence the auncient Fathers haue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their writings, and Å¿ometimes, vÅ¿ed themÅ¿elues, Praier for the dead.

                  <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines</hi> conÅ¿ent in this; that the auncient <hi>Orthodoxall</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neuer vÅ¿ed, or Å¿pake of Prayers for the dead, to the end, that they might haue remiÅ¿Å¿ion of their Å¿innes after this life, that they might be purged from their Å¿innes, or be deliuered from the paines of <hi>Purgatorie:</hi> but the Prayers made for the dead in auncient time, were for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends: and chiefely, they were either prayÅ¿es and thankeÅ¿giuings to God for their departure out of this miÅ¿erable, Å¿infull, and wretched life; and forgiuing them eternall life in the heauens: or elÅ¿e, they were Prayers made in regard of the ReÅ¿urrection of their bodies; that the Lord would Å¿end them a Å¿peedie, and ioyful ReÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: and theÅ¿e Prayers which were made for their friends departed, were not made in regard of any miÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of their Å¿oules, but for the glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:21095:181"/> of their bodies in the ReÅ¿urrection of the iuÅ¿t; that then their glory might be encreaÅ¿ed, and that they might receiue fullneÅ¿Å¿e of glorie both in their bodies, and in their Å¿oules. And this is not a meere opinion, and bare coniecture; but this is according to Å¿ound iudgement; gathered from the writings of the Fathers themÅ¿elues. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <hi>all men did Å¿ay that the Emperour was bleÅ¿Å¿ed, and accepted of God.</hi> It is manifeÅ¿t then, by theÅ¿e Fathers, that the cuÅ¿tome of the auncient Church of God in praying for the dead, was not to procure eaÅ¿e, &amp; to bring refreÅ¿hing to their Å¿oules in <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> or to deliuer them out of <hi>Purgatorie;</hi> Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they acknowledge, that their friends for whom they prayed, were in <hi>light;</hi> were in <hi>glorie;</hi> and were <hi>bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed.</hi>

               <p>In the third place, I yeeld theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons, wherefore we are not to pray for the dead, as the RomiÅ¿ts vÅ¿e Prayer for the dead at this day.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, The Scripture acknowledgeth but two places, as receptacles for the Å¿oules of men after this life, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi> and <hi>Hell:</hi> either to be with <hi rend="sup">h</hi> 
                  <hi>Diues</hi> in hell torments, <note place="margin">1 The Scripture acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth but two places after this life.</note> or with <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abrahams boÅ¿ome,</hi> that is, in ioy and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:21095:181"/> felicity: now they that are in heauen, are in Å¿o great ioyes alreadie, that they cannot be bettered, till the day of the reÅ¿urrection, when they Å¿hall haue fulneÅ¿Å¿e of glory both in bodie and Å¿oule: and they that are in hell, cannot by <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 22. 23</note> any prayers be deliuered thence; as <hi>Abraham</hi> tells <hi>Diues,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 26.</note> 
                  <hi>betweene vs and you there is a great gulfe fixed, Å¿o that they which would paÅ¿Å¿e from hence to you, cannot; neither can they paÅ¿Å¿e to vs, that would come from thence.</hi> From Hell there is no redemption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas the RomiÅ¿h Church teacheth, and <note place="margin">2 All the faithfull and true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers are cleanÅ¿ed from their Å¿innes in this life.</note> holdeth, that they that are caÅ¿t into <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> are of the faithfull Å¿ort, beleeuers; the Scripture prooueth that all the faithfull, all true beleeuers are waÅ¿hed and cleanÅ¿ed from their Å¿innes in this life, and are therefore bleÅ¿Å¿ed af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter this life: For S <hi>Iohn</hi> Å¿aith, <note n="k" place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 7.</note>

                  <hi>He that heareth my word, and beleeueth on him that Å¿ent me, hath euerlaÅ¿ting life, and Å¿hall not come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: but is paÅ¿Å¿ed from death vnto life.</hi> And a voice from heauen Å¿aith vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi>

                  <hi>Write, bleÅ¿Å¿ed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, Å¿aith the Spirit, that they may reÅ¿t from their labours, and their workes doe follow them.</hi> Now, Å¿eeing that the Å¿tate of the faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, is Å¿uch, that they are cleanÅ¿ed, and purified from their Å¿innes in the bloud of <hi>ChriÅ¿t;</hi> Å¿eeing there is no condemnation to them that are in <hi>ChriÅ¿t;</hi> Å¿eeing they that beleeue in <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> Å¿hall not come into condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but paÅ¿Å¿e from death to life; and Å¿eeing that all the faithfull are bleÅ¿Å¿ed when they die, and their workes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, that is, they haue the reward of their workes; then it is euident, that they goe not to any place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before they come to heauen; but vpon their diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olution, they aÅ¿cend to heauen, and are with <hi>ChriÅ¿t.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3 The canonicall Scripture doth not mention prayer for the dead.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Canonicall Scripture doth not Å¿o much as mention Prayer for the dead; no, not in thoÅ¿e places where there is mention of <hi>Å¿acrifices</hi> and <hi>prayer;</hi> yea, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:21095:182"/> of the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>righteous:</hi> but rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>TheÅ¿Å¿alonians</hi> Å¿aith, <note n="o" place="margin">1. <hi>TheÅ¿.</hi> 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>I would not haue you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿leepe, that ye Å¿orrow not, euen as other, which haue no hope.</hi> Where, the <hi>ApoÅ¿tle</hi> giueth vs to vnderÅ¿tand, that if our friends departed, were in any place of torment, if they were in paine and miÅ¿erie, then indeed, we had cauÅ¿e to Å¿orrow and mourne, to pray, and to doe any thing that might procure them eaÅ¿e; but Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>I would not haue you to Å¿orrow as men without hope;</hi> as if he had Å¿aid, If you haue hope, that your friends departed are at reÅ¿t. haue eaÅ¿e, and Å¿hall riÅ¿e againe to glorie; why then doe you Å¿orrow for them as they that haue <hi>no hope,</hi> either of their preÅ¿ent reÅ¿t, or future ReÅ¿urrection to glorie? you Å¿hould rather reioyce, for that they are at reÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, though it cannot be denied, but that <hi>Prayer</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4 Prayer for the dead, though it be auncient, yet is it neither ApoÅ¿tolicall; nor yet vÅ¿ed by the moÅ¿t aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Fathers of the Church, as it is by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿ts at this day.</note> for the dead is an auncient cuÅ¿tome, long vÅ¿ed in the Church: yet notwithÅ¿tanding, I Å¿ay,</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, that it commeth Å¿hort of that antiquitie, to be an <hi>ApoÅ¿tolicall</hi> doctrine. For, before <note n="p" place="margin">Tertul. de coro. mil.</note> 
                  <hi>Turtullians</hi> time, there's little or no mention of Prayer for the dead: and he himÅ¿elfe acknowledgeth, that it hath no firme foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but onely from <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>cuÅ¿tome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the auncient Fathers did not vÅ¿e Prayer for the dead, as the RomiÅ¿h Church doth vÅ¿e it at this day: namely, for the eaÅ¿ing of Å¿oules in <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them from thence; but for other ends, as hath bin Å¿ufficiently declared before: And the auncient Fathers, (if they be rightly vnderÅ¿tood) doe nothing at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the doctrine of the preÅ¿ent RomiÅ¿h Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their manner of praying for the dead.</p>
               <p>The conÅ¿ideration hereof, Å¿erues <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">VÅ¿e. </seg>1</label>
               </p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, to reproue thoÅ¿e, who when they Å¿peake of their <note place="margin">AgainÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that pray for mercie to the Å¿oules of their friends depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> friend, departed, pray that God would haue mercie on their Å¿oules; for although, the Prayers of the auncient Church for the Å¿oules of the dead, might receiue Å¿ome
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:21095:182"/> tollerable interpretation before <hi>Purgatory</hi> was beleeued; yet now, Å¿ince that the RomiÅ¿h Church hath deuiÅ¿ed a <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> and that it is held amongÅ¿t them as an article of faith; it is dangerous to make Å¿uch a Prayer. For this kinde of Prayer that God would haue <hi>mercy on his Å¿oule,</hi> howÅ¿oeuer it may demonÅ¿trate the affection of him that prayeth for his friend departed; yet may it be offenÅ¿iue two wayes:</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, by taking Gods name in vaine, through a too frequent, and common vÅ¿ing of it in ordinarie commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; as the manner of Å¿ome is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by an opinion of Å¿uppoÅ¿ing his friend to be in <hi>Purgatorie:</hi> for in praying for mercie to his Å¿oule, hee Å¿uppoÅ¿eth, (or at leaÅ¿t, breeds an opinion in the mindes of the hearers, that he doth Å¿uppoÅ¿e) that the Å¿oule of his friend departed, is in the paines of <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> and hath neede of mercie to be Å¿hewed to his Å¿oule: whereas it is certaine, that the faithfull departed out of this life, haue obtained mercie before they yeeld vp the GhoÅ¿t, and they are purged &amp; cleanÅ¿ed from their Å¿ins in the bloud of <hi>IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, hence we learne, that although it be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Æ²Å¿e. </seg>2</label> to pray for any one departed in particular, for his <note place="margin">It is no Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tition to laud and praiÅ¿e God for the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our ChriÅ¿tian friends.</note> eaÅ¿e, in, or deliuerie out of <hi>Purgatorie;</hi> yet it is no Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tition, to laud and prayÅ¿e God for the departure of our ChriÅ¿tian friends out of the miÅ¿eries of this mortall life: nor yet, to wiÅ¿h to vs, and them in generall, the haÅ¿tning of <hi>ChriÅ¿t's</hi> Å¿econd comming to iudgement; that we with them, and they with vs, may haue a glorious ReÅ¿urrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and enioy perfect bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿Å¿e both in bodie and Å¿oule.
